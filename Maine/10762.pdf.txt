Senator Craven, Representative Farnsworth, members of the Health and Human Services
Committee, my name is Sue Charron, am the Social Services Director for the City of Lewiston,
and am providing testimony in support of LDs 598; 892; and 1343

Support, with stipulations, LD 1343, An Act to Improve Readiness for Families Facing
Significant Barriers to Employment.
improving services for ASPIRE-TANF participants by offering comprehensive screenings and
referrals that will result in appropriate supports and benefits for families with disabilities and
limitations is a step in the right direction.~ Preparing families for independence is crucial, especially
because the TANF 60-month time limit is now a reality.
“
The language that have difficulty with is ...whether the participant wishes to undergo a
I

comprehensive screening...
Hence, the stipulation is that, if the sen/ices are going to be made available and if the family is
identified as being eligible for sen/ices, the family should be required to participate in order that
referrals can be made for appropriate services, supports and programs. This requirement would
be no different than the mandatory requirements that are placed on ASPIRE participants as a
means to reduce their dependency on TANF.

be proven wrong, but the reality is that homelessness will always exist. However,
a significant amount of homelessness can be prevented and that must be the collaborative focus.
Instead of continuing to work backward and pour limited resources and funds into “fixing” the
problem let's focus on “preventing” the problem. A dollar spent upfront on prevention will reap
several dollars over the long term—- folks in stable housing are less likely to have a need for
expensive emergency services.
Prevention is the key, and working collaboratively, combining resources and funding to expand
upon case management, supportive housing and other crucial sen/ices is the only way that this
endeavor will be successful.

Oppose LD 389, An Act to Bring Fairness
the Method of Municipal Reimbursement.

to

General Assistance Programs by Changing

have previously testified that the current formula for the reimbursement rate, based on property
valuations, isn’t particularly fair and doesn’t make sense, especially when a municipality is
l

impacted by situations beyond its control— mill closings, or the like, and a sizeable population
increase causing high unemployment rates etc., but there is nothing fair about this proposed
method.
it will have no impact on the majority of the municipalities who are currently receiving the 50%
reimbursement rate for all expenditures. It will benefit a minimal number of municipalities—
perhaps unfairly, and it will penalize the handful of municipalities (primarily service center
communities) that are currently receiving the 85% reimbursement rate.
lt must be kept in mind that the 90% reimbursement rate was recently reduced to 85% (supposed
to sunset on 6/30/13, but unlikely) and reducing it even more increases the cost shift to the
municipalities. The City of Lewlston would lose an additional $86,000.00 for FY 2014.
Lewiston’s GA expenditures increased from $169,441.00 in FY 2001 to an estimated $920,358.00
for FY 2014 due to a growing refugee and asylum seeker population, service provider reductions,
and state and federal cuts— most recently impacting TANF recipients and asylum seekers.
Regardless of the increase in expenditures, prior to receiving the 90% reimbursement for 1 ‘/2
months in FY 2010, the last time the city received the 90% reimbursement was in the early 90’s.
Since

FY 2010, we have

received the

90% reimbursement

FY 2011 and

2012.

We started receiving the current 85% reimbursement beginning late April 2013.
We note that the proposed method does not apply to the state’s recognized tribal governments.

any differently.
That being said, everyone must be reminded that permitting families who have been sanctioned
or who have reached the 60-month TANF time limit to receive GA is yet another cost shift to the
municipalities and it is a dissen/ice to the families.

Having the sanction lifted is also a choice, and it is as easy as complying with the TANF/ASPIRE
requirements. It has been proven that when people realize that their actions have real
consequences they are more apt to be accountable.
r

“

A general assistance program provides a specific amount and type of aid for
defined needs during a limited period of time and is not intended to be a continuing “grant-inPer Statute,

aid” or categorical” welfare program.”
By default, the GA program has become a replacement benefit program for the families who have
reached the 60-month TANF time limit, and in turn becomes a continuing “grant-in-aid" program
in order to meet the long term needs of these families. This is not the intent of the program.
The GA program does not have the resources that the ASPIRE program offers, such as job
development, and child care and transportation allowances, specifically set up to assist families in
achieving self-sufficiency.

.

Regardless of whether a family is assisted or denied, the intake is time consuming, and the
additional work surrounding the eligibility or ineligibility for TANF extensions is even more time
intensive. We continue to see new timed out TANF recipients each month and administrative
costs are not reimbursed by the State.
As of March 27, 2013, the city of Lewiston has completed intakes on 127 families, consisting of
553 household members, who have lost their TANF benefits. We have assisted 44 households,
consisting of 175 household members with $24,000 in general assistance. That amount may
appear to be relatively minimal for 44 households, especially when 25% of the households are
large refugee families—- 55% of all household members are refugees. The $24,000 is reﬂective of
the fact that a high percentage of the families, especially the refugee families, live in subsidized
housing. if the majority of the families were living in fair market housing our expenses would be

_

much

higher.

Other municipalities are seeing fewer families but have higher expenditures because their
families are residing in fair market housing, and as we see more families each month we will
probably see more families in fair market housing and that will have an impact on our
expenditures.
