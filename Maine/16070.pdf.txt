The work-search-before-welfare requirement is important both in principle and in practice.
Hardworking taxpayers are tired of providing beneﬁts to those who either don’t need them or
take advantage of them, and as a matter of principle, those who are able to work should be
expected to put in an effort to ask for work before asking for Welfare.

the time.

It’s unfortunate because there are

many truly needy people

out there

who Want to work but just

need help. Maine taxpayers are willing to help them. But the looser our welfare system is, the
more people grow tired of funding it, and that is ultimately detrimental to our neediest citizens.
Let’s bring some accountability to our welfare system and not wear down Maine taxpayers’
tolerance for funding

it.

One important thing I hope the committee will consider in work session on this bill are the
federal ﬁnes racked up by Maine’s TAN F system. We have heard a lot about the $13 million in
ﬁnes imposed by the federal government from 2007 to 2010——ﬁnes imposed because only about
10 percent of two-adult households receiving TANF meet the federal work requirements. We
have heard about these ﬁnes within the context of the bill to eliminate work search exceptions,
but this bill to require an upfront work search requirement would also improve Maine’s TANF

compliance rate and prevent future federal penalties.

I’d

like to add that I understand the perils of poverty. I lived it myself growing up in
Washington County, where my father struggled to support his large family through cold Maine
winters. When I was a kid, welfare beneﬁts were a little harder to come by, and you didn’t see
the intergenerational culture of dependency that you see today. Welfare wasn’t a lifestyle. It
was something that people avoided because they saw it as a last resort.

Finally,

I

good faith attempt to gain bipartisan support for welfare reform. If there
something the Committee would like to amend, I would welcome any suggestion. Let’s have a

offer this bill as a true,

is

conversation about welfare reform.

With

that, I

would be happy

to

answer any questions the Committee

may have.
