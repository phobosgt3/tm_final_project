Temporary Assistance

for Needy Families (TANF) is an extremely valuable resource
who are barely getting by. This program provides relief for parents and
children who are living in poverty and need help paying for basic necessities such as
for families

and laundry. For a family of three, the monthly benefit is only
nowhere near enough to meet a families’ cost of living. LD 1815, LD
1820, and LD 1822 would have devastating impacts on families who are looking for
temporary assistance to get back on their feet. We find these bills only demonize
those who are looking for help to get by. These bills do not address the real problem

LD

1842 would eliminate “good cause” for people unable to meet TANF participation
disabilities, no transportation, or victims of domestic violence.
This elimination would result in a higher number of people sanctioned, without income and
resulting in homelessness. LD 1842 also repeals the Parents as Scholars program, which offers
TANF recipients a route out of poverty and back on their feet. LD 1842 is a step backwards for
requirements such as those with
