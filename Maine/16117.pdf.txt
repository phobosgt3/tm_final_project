Services, thank

Joint Standing

you for the opportunity

to

My name is Rick McCarthy and I am here today testifying

of this legislation on behalf of the Maine Community Action
(MCAA), which is comprised of Maine’s ten community action

Association
agencies

(CAP ’s).

The CAP’s mission is to eliminate and alleviate the causes and conditions of
poverty by assisting low-income individuals to move toward self-sufﬁciency.
Each year, we serve 200,000 Maine residents providing a variety of services,
including Head Start and child care, housing assistance, fuel assistance, and
transportation services.

We are pleased to
Keith Small, Executive Director

Members of the

Senator Craven, Representative Farnsworth, and

support this legislation, which

fraud and abuse that

is

designed to identify waste,
taking place in the MaineCare, TANF, and Food
is

Supplement Programs. MCAA is a strong supporter of these essential programs
Maine low-income families. Together, they are key parts of the safety
net. The state does have an obligation to make certain that state funds are used
appropriately and efﬁciently in these programs.

MCAA supports reasonable efforts to make certain beneﬁts and services are
delivered only to those

who

are eligible.

We make extensive efforts

in the

programs we administer, such as LIHEAP, to conﬁrm eligibility and to identify
and prevent fraud. However, we ﬁnd that fraud is exceedingly rare. At some
point, efforts to identify and prevent fraud reach a point of diminishing retums.
Every dollar spent on enforcement is a dollar that cannot be sent on services. The
proper level of enforcement, including the appropriate regulatory standards and
stafﬁng,

is

an issue

we

are always discussing with our state

and federal partners.

i

appropriate and necessary for the state to continually assess the level of its enforcement
we have seen
efforts for MaineCare, TANF, and the Food Supplement Program. In recent years
It is

expanded efforts to identify and prosecute illegal use of these programs. Anecdotally, there have
been reasonable questions raised about the efﬁcacy of those efforts about whether the state has
received a good retum on the resources invested. LD 1829 will provide for thoughtful oversight
of those efforts by this Committee. That is exactly the kind of oversight you should have over the
Administration.

For that reason,

Thank you

MCAA is pleased to support LD

for your time

and

attention.

would be happy

to take

any questions.
