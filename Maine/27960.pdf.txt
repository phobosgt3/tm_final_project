difficult to access vital help through the General Assistance program.
Genuine reform efforts should focus on the underlying problems, the lack of
affordable housing and untreated mental illness, instead of simply
punishing people and making it more likely that they end up on the streets.

The proposed changes undermine an essential part of our state’s safety

General Assistance is a big piece in this puzzle; a very important piece.
Often, it is the only source of financial support for people we care about.
People we all care about: families, veterans, those struggling with mental
illness. lt is truly a program of last resort. It is also a program that helps to
rebuild lives.

Let’s not forget the obligation to help keep people alive.
Thank you.
