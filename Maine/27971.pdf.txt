We learned from a representative sample of TANF families in 2010 that most families
receiving TANF in Maine do so for less than two years. Those who receive beneﬁts for
longer periods of time are very likely to have an adult or child with a disability—this was
true for nearly 90% of those families receiving TANF for ﬁve years or more in the 2010
study (McLaughlin

with disabilities can apply for an extension of TANF beneﬁts, our studies found that
many do not know they can apply, are advised not to apply, or are denied the extension.

Among the

families in our ﬁrst study, nearly two-ﬁfths (3 9%) had an adult with a work-

and one-quarter (26%) had a child or other dependent family member
with a disability. These families were no longer receiving TANF despite the fact that an
extension for families coping with disability is provided for by law. Over two-ﬁfths
(41%) of the families had less than a high school diploma. Clearly many of these
families will be unable to work through no fault of their own due to disabilities or
inability to ﬁnd employment due to a lack of skills. Those individuals who were working
were making very low-wages (with an average of $9 per hour) and were only able to
work part-time. After losing TANF, 40% of the families in our study had no income

remind you these are families with children. There is substantial research indicating that
the consequences of severe poverty for children are profound and long lasting, impacting
brain development and lifetime outcomes in terms of education, employment, public
welfare receipt and criminal activity (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011).

(PTSD) from

a previous abusive relationship. She had applied for

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) prior to losing TANF, but had been denied. Her
husband has a physical disability after many years of working in the woods and with

heavy machinery. He was in the process of applying for Social Security Disability
Insurance (SSDI) at the time of the ﬁrst interview, and was waiting for a decision at the
time of the second.

The loss of TANF resulted in Kate losing her apartment and her family breaking apart.
The two youngest children were taken from her by the Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) and placed in foster care——at some expense to the State—due to her
loss of housing. She was allowed unsupervised visitation until she secured stable housing
and her children could live with her again. She sent two other children to live with their
father, the man who had previously abused her; she was not happy about doing this but
he had income from disability beneﬁts that would help to support the children and she
had none and no other options for their care. Ultimately, he was unable to adequately care
for the children and they too came under State care. Kate was denied an extension of

With the help of GA and her caseworker, Kate was able to secure a new apartment and
reunite with her children. At the time of the second interview, she had begun receiving
SSI and was extremely relieved to have her children with her again. General Assistance
was critical in helping her to regain stability in a crisis for which she had no other source
of help.

one story among many of families who have lost their TANF beneﬁts and who
may need help from their towns through the GA program. Families losing TANF
beneﬁts due to the 60-month time limit are some of our most vulnerable in the state.
They have signiﬁcant barriers to employment and often need additional help to become
economically independent. General Assistance can help ease some of the hardships they
face and help to keep families together and stable, ultimately saving the State money.

for allowing

to provide this written testimony in opposition to this

proposed cut in General Assistance. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance as
you consider the merits of removing this support for such vulnerable Maine families with
children.
