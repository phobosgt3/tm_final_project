CERTIFICATION OF CITY COUNCIL ACTION
I, Kathleen M. Montejo, City Clerk of Lewiston, Maine, do hereby certify that the following action was
taken by the Lewiston City Council at a public meeting of the City Council, held on Thursday, April 9,

2015:

RESOLVE, EXPRESSING THE CITY COUNCIL’S CONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR LD 368,
AN ACT TO INTEGRATE THE STATE’S GENERAL ASSISTANCE AND
TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES PROGRAMS

VOTE (1)
Motion by Councilor Cayer, seconded by Councilor Bouchard:

To approve the Resolve

authorizing the City Administrator to dispose of the property at 10 College Street:

Whereas, General Assistance

is

a locally administered but state mandated program; and

Whereas, in recent years, changes to
effect

Whereas, in January 2012, the
receive
that

state welfare

programs have not always taken into account

their

on General Assistance; and
state

began enforcing a lifetime

limit

TANF beneﬁts but allowing for certain extensions

make

it

due to reasons such as a disability

impossible for an individual to be employed; and

Whereas, capping Temporary Assistance to Needy Families
recipients

of 60 months for an individual to

from the

state/federal

at

60 months has resulted in moving some

system to General Assistance, thus increasing the costs of the

General Assistance program; and

Whereas, since January 2012, 88 applicants representing 333 individuals who have reached the 60 month
limit have moved onto the General Assistance program at a total cost of $100,133; and
Whereas, the state’s share of General Assistance

is

higher

thm its

share of the

TANF program’s

costs;

and

Whereas, moving recipients from a federally subsidized program to the state/locally ftmded General
Assistance program

Whereas,

it is

may actually

increase costs to both the state and to the City; and

essential that state/federal/local Welfare

programs be organized and administered in a

coordinated fashion to ensure that changes and modiﬁcations to one program do not lead to
unanticipated impacts on the other; and

Whereas,

LD 368 provides that a person who is not eligible for the TANF program due to exhausting
the
60 month lifetime limit on TANF would be ineligible to receive
municipal General Assistance,
thus eliminating the transfer of such individuals to the city’s
General Assistance program;

Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved by the City Council of the City of Lewiston
our conditional support for
Assistance for
individuals

LD

368, An Act to Integrate the

who

are waiting for the State

Human

Services to rule on their application and allowing municipalities
ﬂexibility to continue to provide General Assistance beneﬁts during
