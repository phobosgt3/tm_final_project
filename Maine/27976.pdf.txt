Conditional Support for L.D. 368
An Act To Integrate the State's General Assistance and Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families Programs
On April 9, 2015, the Lewiston City Council voted 7-0 to adopt a Resolve to conditionally
support LD 368. While supporting the general concept that those who have reached the
60 month TANF limit would be ineligible for GA, the Resolve requests the Legislature
consider allowing a continuation of general assistance to those who have a TANF
extension application pending and allowing for a transition period for current GA
recipients who would no longer qualify for assistance. The resolve is attached.
Since the TANF 60 time limit was implemented in January 2012, the Lewiston GA
program has completed intakes on 177 households consisting of 733 persons who are
no longer eligible for TANF. Of them, 88 households consisting of 333 persons have
received assistance in the amount of $100,133. That amount would be much higher if it

due

to the

60-month time limit. Regardless of whether a family is assisted or denied, the intake is
time consuming and the additional work surrounding the eligibility or ineligibility for TANF
extensions is even more time intensive. All of the administrative time and expenditures
associated with processing the TANF 60 cases result in cost shifts to the municipality.

“A

general assistance program provides a specific amount and type of aid
Per Statute,
for defined needs during a limited period of time and is not intended to be a
continuing “grant-in-aid” or categorical” welfare program.” Enforcing the TANF
60-month time limit forces many families to apply for General Assistance to meet their
basic needs for rent, utiiities, and personal supplies — an ineffective substitution at best
because municipal General Assistance programs do not have the resources that DHHS
has in its ASPIRE program, Many of the families who have timed out of TANF after 5
years (and in some cases 10 plus years) do not have the English skills, high school

diplomas or GEDs, or employment skills to obtain sustainable employment. Our current
caseload consists of families who lack the resources and skills to be self-sufficient and,
as a result, have been receiving GA since losing their TANF benefits in 2013 and 2014.
The GA program has become a continuing “grant-in-aid” program in order to meet the
long term needs of these families, and that is not the intent of the program.

The City of Lewiston continues to be impacted by applicants who are ineligible for State

applications from Legal Permanent Residents residing in the U.S. for less than five
years. Asylum seekers continue to arrive in Lewiston and expenditures for this

For a significant majority of asylum seekers, any delay in the employment authorization
process not only serves as a barrier to economic self-sufficiency but places the
economic burden of supporting the individual and/or a family directly onto the shoulders
