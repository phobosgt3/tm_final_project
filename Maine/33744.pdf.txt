Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) provides assistance for families with
young children — families who are living in poverty and struggling to meet their basic
needs. TANF provides hope for these families and children in this time of crisis.

1144 would place further restrictions on EBT use, and would harm children, seniors,
and people with disabilities. Placing harsh penalties on those suspected of misusing their
beneﬁts is dangerous as it could lead to families no longer being able to provide food or
housing for themselves. It would pit communities against each other, encouraging
neighbors to turn people in who they believe used TANF beneﬁts for certain purchases.
They likely don’t know these families’ circumstances, or whether they used hard-earned
wages to pay for things rather than cash from their TANF beneﬁt.

already mentioned, but takes these ideas further and creates even more
hurdles for struggling families to overcome. For example, this bill would restrict families
from withdrawing more than 15% of their monthly beneﬁt amount. Many people who
receive TANF need to pay rent with cash from their TANF beneﬁt. However, under this
bill, they would no longer be able to do that. You can’t pay rent with an EBT card. If
this bill passes, families and children will be left homeless.
