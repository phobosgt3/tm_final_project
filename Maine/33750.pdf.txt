I

Temporary Assistance
This

bill

for

Needy Families Program.

puts up unhelpful roadblocks for victims of domestic violence.

unrealistic to ask victims of domestic violence

new place

find a

who

are in

crisis,

It is

perhaps trying to

to live, or navigate the court system, or parent their children

through trauma—indeed,

many victims

will

be doing

all

three of these things—to

apply for not one, not two, but three jobs before they can access TANF benefits.
Such a policy will set victims up for failure, at a time when they are most vulnerable

and

in

need of support. So many of the families

who

reach out to our resource

centers are existing in survival mode; they are focused on escaping the abuser, on
filing for

protection orders in court, on trying to find a roof to put over their and

their children's heads.

TANF

benefits can be an important lifeline during this time;

delaying access can be detrimental not only to their immediate self-sufficiency, but
to their safety.

The policy proposed

in

LD 452

will

prove damaging to victims‘ chances of long-term

Access to financial resources contributes significantly to a victim's
decision whether to leave or to stay in an abusive relationship. When we make it
self-sufficiency.

more

difficult for

victims to access the social safety net they depend on to meet their

and their children’s basic needs—-for example, by setting up an arbitrary number of
TAN F funds—we
make it more likely that that victim will decide that there are no options other than

job applications they need to apply for before they can access

to live

with the abuse.
