Imagine next being asked to look for three jobs in a small community knowing you couldn’t take that
job even if you got it because of your current circumstances. If you apply for the job and don’t take it
you burn a bridge with one of the few employers in your community with whom you may someday
hope to be able to take a job. When thinking about this proposal from this perspective it becomes far
less reasonable.

We understand that this bill does,

years ago, this Committee gave

its

unanimous support

to legislation that subsequently

became

law establishing a new assessment process for TANF recipients which is performed by contracted
staff from the Maine Medical Center Vocational Department. These comprehensive assessments form
the basis for individual plans to help TANF parents overcome barriers that limit their ability to work.
This bill was enacted because of the increasing prevalence of disability and other serious barriers to
employment faced by TANF families. It was also enacted because it was recognized that DHHS staff
did not have the expertise necessary to

make meaningful

employability deterrninations given the

nature and extent of the barriers that these families face. Yet this

an extension to that limit if they can show evidence of a hardship including disability, a child with a
disability, domestic violence and certain other barriers that prevent them from working. We have seen
numerous cases in which families eligible for hardships did not receive them. Moreover, two studies
