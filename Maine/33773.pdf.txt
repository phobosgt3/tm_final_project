Here in Maine, our own study of the Parents as Scholars Program indicated signiﬁcant
increases in earnings and general well-being for participants in the program as they
eamed their degrees [3]; Despite this high level of success, I note that LD 1375,would
make it far moredifﬁcult for students to participate in the Parents as Scholars program by
adding even‘ more burdensome requirements. As a professor I have taught many PaS
students overthe years, I can assure you that these students are already working harder
than most giventhe demands of balancing a full academic schedule with, those of single
parenting. I see this new requirement as a prescription for academic failure.

More recently, our examination of the impact of the 60-month TANF Time Limitlaw has
let us know that parents in more than half the families reaching the time limit lacked a
high school education. These individuals lose their beneﬁts without the necessary
education and skills to support their families. Many respondents in the study indicated
