on behalf of

Screening and Testing for Illegal

Substances of Beneﬁciaries under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

Program.
Public beneﬁts are a vital resource for low income families. While there has been

much mentioned about the need for these beneﬁts to be temporary, I believe the
most important word in the program title, Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families, is families. This Word indicates that there are children in the home and
these beneﬁts should be used to cloth, feed and house them.

Unfortunately,

LD 1407 seeks to institute a questionnaire that all seeking ﬁnancial assistance via
TANF beneﬁts must complete upon application. If the results of the screening
indicate a reasonable likelihood that the applicant

test.

While the vast majority of individuals who utilize the TANF program do so
responsibly, as I mentioned already, many recent drug busts have revealed several
beneﬁt cards that have been trafficked as cash to pay for drugs. This committee
often hears testimony on the ravages of drug addiction and We know well that the

another potential tool to help us identify individuals at risk for drug addiction and

them into an intervention program, ensure that public assistance is being used in
the manner for which it was intend and help to stabilize families in need.
