GA and TANF

are a last resort safety net designed to assist individuals and families with

housing, food, clothing, medicine and other basic necessities. These programs, by definition,

serve those without access to other resources.

LD 10, 36, 219, and 220 ultimately magnify the fiscal, social and public safety costs

These proposals may, on paper, reduce dependence on General Assistance and TANF merely by
restricting access, but they fail to include evidence based, effective, and cost efficient strategies
to address the underlying causes of homelessness and extreme poverty.
