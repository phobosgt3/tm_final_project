Joint Standing

will cover all six of the General Assistance bills being discussed today.

Penalty for Falsely Representing Information on an Application for General Assistance

making false statements in order to receive GA. The GA program is meant to assist the neediest
residents of Maine Who are unable to provide thebasic necessities essential to maintain
themselves or their families. This bill acts to ensure and improve program integrity.
