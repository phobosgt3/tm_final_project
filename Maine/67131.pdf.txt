Human Services regarding testimony

Good

afternoon Senator Brakey and Representative Hymanson and members of the Joint
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
name is Frank D’Alessandro. I

My

am the

Southern Regional Directing Attorney for Pine Tree Legal Assistance.
speaking today in opposition to LD 10; LD 36; and LD 219 and LD 220.

I

am

l

have asked to share the expertise of Pine Tree Legal Assistance on these issues and I am
speaking today on behalf of Pine Tree Legal Assistance. Since 1967 Pine Tree Legal
Assistance has provided ﬁree legal services to low-income people throughout the State of
Maine. In 2016, Pine Tree Legal Assistance provided legal services to Maine families
and individuals in over 7,363 cases, of which 642 involved public assistance, including
I

general assistance cases.

We

oppose these bills because they threaten to further weaken the already fragile safety
net available to help low-income Mainers and the inevitable negative impact that these
bills will

‘

have upon the State’s most vulnerable residents. Whatever problems the State

currently faces, they are not the result of the poorest Mainers having too

much.

DESCRIPTION OF GENERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
General Assistance

Mainers

come

who

in the

the oldest public assistance program in the State for low-income
have no other way to pay for basic necessities. General Assistance beneﬁts
is

form of a voucher

that

is

paid directly to the vendor for items such as food,

clothing, housing, heat, or medical care. Since the General Assistance

program of last resort, Maine municipalities grant beneﬁts only
to meet a speciﬁc need.

“Need” is deﬁned by Maine statute and municipal
person's income,

i

for a

program

is

a

speciﬁc time period

ordinance as “the condition whereby a

money,

property, credit, assets or other resources available to provide
basic necessities for the individual and the individual's family are less than the maximtun
levels of assistance established by the municipality” Maximum levels of assistance
vary
from county to county and, sometimes, from municipality to municipality. However, in

.

5

E

.

/

E
2

l

all cases,

the

maximum level of assistance

is

only a fraction of the federal poverty

guidelines.

The

current statute that governs the general assistance program

4301

is

found

at

22 M.R.S.

The General Assistance program includes a work requirement. The law
currently mandates recipients work in order to receive their general assistance beneﬁt for
food, shelter, or help with heat. The statue imposes a 120 day (4 month) general
assistance disqualiﬁcation for those applicants who make false representations in
their General Assistance applications or who fail to comply with the General Assistance
work requirement.
et.

seq.

In addition, an applicant for general assistance is required to apply for other available

public assistance programs.

anyone who commits ﬁaud in connection with
another public assistance program becomes ineligible from receiving general assistance
for the same length of time the person is ineligible for the other beneﬁt program.

The poorest demographic in Maine are children. According to the 2016 Maine KIDS
Count survey, currently 19% of Maine children live in poverty (nearly one in ﬁve
children in the State of Maine). This number has increased from 16% in 2008. (Nearly
one in six children

TANF categorically ineligible for general assistance this bill will have the effect of
deepening the level of poverty, and increasing the risk of homelessness, experienced
by
the most vulnerable segment of our population, those who had no choice in creating their
situation or ability to change their circumstance, our children.

2

We also oppose these bills because they are likely to increase homelessness
By limiting the assistance provided by general assistance to Maine’s most vulnerable
populations these bills will severely limit the ability of low-income individuals to
maintain current housing or arrange for alternative housing, thereby increasing the
become homeless. As We all know the consequences
of homelessness are severe, both to the family and to society. They include the
exacerbation of problems which may have caused homelessness. Homeless people have
likelihood that these individuals will

I

r

less access to housing, jobs, health care,

and basic needs like food and clothing. Isolation
and lack of social support are well-documented aspects of homelessness, particularly for
people living with mental health or substance abuse disorders. Homeless women and men
have signiﬁcantly less family support and this often limits opportunities for recovery and
prevention.

Once an individual becomes homeless,

it is

likely that
