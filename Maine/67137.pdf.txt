l0 would increase the penalty for falsely representing information on an application for

general assistance.

It's

important to note that a penalty already exists. This act would increase

it

from 120 days to 24 months. I formerly served as the Health and Human Services Director for
the City of Bangor. I can tell you that we did not often have GA applicants give us false
information. Maine people are proud and they are generally reluctant to even request help and
only rarely scheme to get more assistance. For those
existing 120

day punishment

is

who do

provide false information, the

sufﬁcient.

The proposed 9 month limit on GA beneﬁts, LD 36, is the return of another bad idea. Most GA
recipients are only on the program for a short time and work hard to get off. But there are some
who take longer to get on their feet. This is especially signiﬁcant for housing, which is more than
70% of GA costs. One of the worst things that can happen to a family is to become homeless.
The road back to stable housing is a long one and oﬁen requires signiﬁcant public assistance. In
the long run, it is much cheaper to keep people housed. Today, families must continue to meet
the eligibility requirements to receive GA beyond 9 months. We do not want to force lowincome households with no other options out of their homes. Please reject LD 36.

LD 219 is another proposal in search of a problem.

applicants to review other available assistance and to pursue

GA. Adding

a

penalty serves no purpose here.
I am surprised by LD 220 because the result of passing this proposal is that some low-income
working families would be left with few options. It would take GA away for ﬁve years from
families who have exhausted their 60 month TANF eligibility. In other words, a family unable to
get on their feet alter ﬁve years would not be able to access GA in an emergency for the next ﬁve
years. Regardless of your view of the parents in this scenario, think what this will mean for the
children of those families. In a crisis, they will not beneﬁt from the housing, food or health care
that GA could provide. Our public policy should be focused on helping those children become
productive adults, not on making the journey to adulthood even harder.
