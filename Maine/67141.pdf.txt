Real reform does not simply cut people off from help they need. Instead we need to do a
better job from day one getting people the tools they need to ﬁnd and keep a job so they no
longer need welfare. Many people in Maine come on and off the program because they are
churning in and out of low-paying, insecure jobs. We need to help these people get the
education and training they needl so they can get a better paying, more reliable job for the
long-tenn. This up-front investment in families today will ensure that they have every
opportunity to leave welfare and poverty behind permanently in the years to come. We know
that over half of the people who lost TANF due to time limits in 2011 lacked a high school
degree or the equivalent. These families did not move from welfare to w0rk— instead life
simply got harder and kids in these families went without basics like a home and enough food
to eat.

circumstances change and they become eligible well before that time period is up.
