General Assistance program is a critical component of moving people out of shelters, keeping

There are already signiﬁcant penalties for deliberately falsifying information to obtain GA.
Adding a more punitive disqualiﬁcation time-period will put people at serious risk. For
example, while appealing a wrongful decision, a family would have to do without this crucial

Current law already requires people receiving General Assistance to apply for all other

supplying receipts for all purchases made to ensure they are only buying necessities before they
qualify for GA. It can be a confusing process best left to those who administer it without arbitrary

The proposed change appears unduly punitive to families living in poverty. Housing costs have risen beyond a
reasonable threshold for many families. In addition to onerous rent, it is often a struggle to cover the cost of
