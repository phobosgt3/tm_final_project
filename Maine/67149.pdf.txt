Support for LD 219. Since the General Assistance law was modernized in the 1970s
and early 1980s from the pre-existing “pauper laws” GA recipients have been required to make
,

use of all available and potential resources, but there are limited tools in statute to address the

circumstance of a recipient forfeiting those resources once they are obtained.

LD 219 was

developed by the Maine Welfare Directors Association several years ago in an attempt to
establish some accountability with respect to some GA recipients’ refusal to recognize the value
of the programmatic resources that are being provided to them outside of the
these recipients of

GA program. When

Assistance from the community, our local administrators become justiﬁably frustrated.

application of an inappropriate

Under the earlier “pauper laws” out of which the modern General Assistance program
was created 40 years ago, a municipality’s ﬁnancial responsibility from public assistance was
determined by the applicant’s “settlement” which was his or her municipality of birth until the
applicant had “settled” in another municipality for a period of at least ﬁve years. The courts,
