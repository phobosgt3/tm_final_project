In Opposition to

LDs 220 and 36

Submitted to the

JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE

ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

April 10, 2017

Senator Brakey, Representative Hymanson, and members of the Committee on Health and

Human

Services, greetings.

My name is Meagan Sway, and I am a Justice Fellow with the

Union of Maine, a statewide organization committed to advancing and
preserving civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our
members, we ask you to vote ought not to pass on LDs 220 and 36.

While the ACLU believes this policy is unwise, not in keeping with the purpose of
General Assistance, and likely result in an increase in homelessness in Maine, we are also
concerned that LD 220 could open the state up to lawsuits under the Americans With Disabilities
Act (the “ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”).

This is true even with the carve out for those waiting to hear on their extension applications, because LD
220 would apply to the 83 percent of Mainers with disabilities who are being denied extensions by DHHS
even though they have work-limiting disabilities.

For example, in 2013, the State of Massachusetts settled a lawsuit brought against it for violations of the
ADA in administering welfare beneﬁts. See Harper v. Mass. Dep ’t Transitional Assistance, No. 0712351-MLW (D. Mass. Jan. 16, 2013) (Settlement Agreement). As part of that agreement, Massachusetts
had to pay plaintiffs and their attorneys $975,000. Id. p. 35.

And, in conjunction with proposed and existing MaineCare eligibility restrictions, it is unlikely that a
childless person needing more than nine months of General Assistance would have easy access to a doctor
