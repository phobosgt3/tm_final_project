3. Administration. The department may administer and operate a program of aid to
needy dependent children, called "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families" or
"TANF," who are deprived of support or care due to the death, continued absence,
physical or mental incapacity of a parent or the unemployment or underemployment of
the principal wage earner in accordance with the United States Social Security Act, as
amended by PRWORA and DRA, and this Title.

A. The department shall adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer the
program. The rules must include eligibility criteria, budgeting process, benefit
calculation and confidentiality.
The confidentiality rules must ensure that
confidentiality is maintained for TANF recipients at least to the same extent that
confidentiality was maintained for families in the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program unless otherwise required by federal law or regulation.

B. The department may use funds, insofar as resources permit, provided under and in
accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for
this purpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide assistance to
families under this chapter. In addition to assistance for families described in this
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:

21

23

(1) To continue the pass-through of the first $50 per month of current child
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass-through from the budget
tests and benefit calculations;

(2) To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United
States who are receiving assistance under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.
Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as
aliens under PRWORA. Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of
assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of
July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that household
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility
for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance
through a state-funded program unless that noncitizen is:

(a) Elderly or disabled, as described under the laws governing supplemental
security income in 42 United States Code, Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);

39

(b) A victim of domestic violence;

(c) Experiencing other hardship, such as time necessary to obtain proper

those individuals who qualify for TANF under the United States Social Security
Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated for the

property taxes equal or exceed 75% of their monthly income. The special
housing allowance is limited to $200 $300 per month for each family. For
purposes of this subparagraph, "monthly income" means the total of the TANF
monthly benefit and all income countable under the TANF program, plus child
support received by the family, excluding the $50 pass-through payment;

employment, the department shall disregard from monthly earnings the
following:

bridges to employment, by providing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or

$300 the special housing allowance for families receiving TANF benefits.
