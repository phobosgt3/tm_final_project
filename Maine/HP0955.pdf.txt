This bill requires an adult applicant for or an adult recipient of benefits under the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program to be screened and
possibly physically tested for the unlawful use of drugs. The outcome of testing may
result in that person's being denied or losing TANF benefits if subsequent substance use
disorder treatment is not successfully completed. The bill also repeals provisions that
prohibit the State's denying food assistance and TANF assistance to a person who has
been convicted of a drug-related felony.
