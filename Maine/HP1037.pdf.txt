17-A. Denial of assistance based on felony drug offense. An individual convicted
of a felony drug offense after August 22, 1996 is not eligible for TANF assistance. As
used in this subsection, "felony drug offense" means an offense that, at the time of
conviction, is punishable by imprisonment for one year or more under any law of the
United States or of any state and that has as an element the possession, use or distribution
of a controlled substance as defined in Section 102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act,
21 United States Code 802(6) or a scheduled drug as defined in Title 17-A, section 1101,
subsection 11. "Felony drug offense" does not include conviction of a crime under the
laws of another state that is classified by laws of that state as a misdemeanor and is
punishable by a term of imprisonment of 2 years or less. This subsection must be applied
retroactively to current recipients of and new applicants for TANF assistance.

Current law prohibits a person who has been convicted of a drug-related felony from
being denied Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, benefits due to that
conviction. Current law also allows the drug testing of a person receiving TANF benefits
if the person has been convicted of a drug-related felony within 20 years of receiving
TANF. If the drug test is positive for illegal drugs, a 2nd test may be requested by the
person and, if the 2nd test is positive, the suspension of TANF benefits may be avoided
by enrolling in a substance abuse treatment program.

This bill repeals the prohibition against the denial of TANF benefits for a conviction
of a drug-related felony, instead providing that anyone who is convicted for a drugrelated felony after August 22, 1996 is ineligible for TANF benefits, including a person
who is receiving TANF benefits on the effective date of the legislation. The bill also
repeals the provision allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer drug tests to persons convicted of a drug-related felony and the person who

Sec. 4. 22 MRSA §3762, sub-§20, as reallocated by RR 2011, c. 1, §33, is

tests positive for illegal drug use to avoid the loss of benefits. The bill requires an
applicant for or recipient of TANF benefits to declare in a written, signed statement
whether the person or any member of that person's household has been convicted of a
drug-related felony.
