has been convicted of a drug-related felony, as described in Section 115 of

B. If a person the result of a written screening tool completed by an applicant under

program appropriate to the type of illegal drug being used or the controlled substance
being used abused by that person applicant, as described in paragraph B,

program.

using an illegal drug or abusing a controlled substance, the department may require
the recipient to complete a written screening tool to determine the recipient's
likelihood of current substance use. If the result of the written screening tool
confirms that reasonable suspicion, the provisions of paragraphs B to E apply as if the
recipient were an applicant.

SUMMARY

This bill requires an applicant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or
TANF, benefits to complete a written screening tool to determine the applicant's
likelihood of current substance use. This bill also allows the Department of Health and
Human Services, if it has a reasonable suspicion that a recipient of TANF benefits is
using an illegal drug or abusing a controlled substance, to require the recipient to
complete a written screening tool to determine the TANF recipient's likelihood of
substance use.

22

If the results of the screening tool or other factors provide the department with a
reasonable suspicion that the applicant or recipient is using an illegal drug or abusing a
controlled substance, the department must identify and pay for an appropriate substance
abuse treatment program for the applicant or recipient as a condition of obtaining or
receiving benefits.

23

27

If the applicant or recipient refuses to enroll in a treatment program, the applicant or
recipient may appeal the denial of benefits but is subject to a drug test. If the applicant or
recipient fails the drug test and is unsuccessful with the appeal, the applicant or recipient
may still enroll in substance abuse treatment as a condition of obtaining or receiving
benefits.
