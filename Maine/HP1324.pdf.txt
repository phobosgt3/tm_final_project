medical records or any other credible information related to the participant's ability to
participate in program activities. An assessment under this subsection may also be

6. Education, training and employment services. The ASPIRE-TANF program
must make available a broad range of education, training and employment services in
accordance with section 3781-A, subsection 3 and the federal Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 and
the federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Public Law 109-171, 120 Stat. 4. These
services and activities must include all of those services and activities offered by the
Additional Support for People in Retraining and Employment Program on October 1,
1989, except in 2-year and 4-year postsecondary education and except as provided in
chapter 1054-B. This section does not prohibit the department from purchasing
equivalent services from providers other than those from whom those services were
purchased on October 1, 1989. When a particular approved education or training service
is available at comparable quality and cost, including the cost of support services, and the
implementation of the family contract would not be unreasonably delayed, the program
participant may choose to enroll for that service with the provider of that person's

preference. If this decision is not mutually agreed to by the participant and the case
manager, the decision must be reviewed by the case manager's supervisor. These services
do not include reimbursement for the cost of tuition or mandatory fees for postsecondary
education unless:

6

A. The participant is unable to secure other educational funding needed to complete
the participant's family contract due to:

7

(1) Poor credit as determined by the educational funding source; or

8
9

(2) The consideration by the educational funding source of resources from past
years that are not actually available to the participant;

10
11
12

B. In the determination of the department, failure to pay the tuition or fee would
result in higher ASPIRE-TANF program costs to achieve the participant's approved
goal; or

13

C. The participant meets an exception specified in rules adopted by the department.

14
15
16
17
18

When a substantially similar postsecondary education or training program of comparable
quality is available at both a public and private institution, within a reasonable
commuting distance for the participant, the department may choose to approve the
program offered at the public institution if the participant's program can be completed at
less cost at the institution.

and their participation is not limited to 24 months. The department shall encourage
recipients younger than 20 years of age who have not completed high school to attend
traditional high school.

Sec. 21. 22 MRSA §3788, sub-§11, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 335, §3, is
amended to read:
D. If a claim of disability or other good cause is made by a participant, the
department shall assess the circumstances of the claim. If good cause disability is
found to exist, the department shall offer reasonable alternative participation
requirements if and to the extent required by federal law, and document them in the
participant's family contract and case record.
