adult from obtaining or retaining gainful employment, being a victim of domestic
violence, participating in good standing in an approved education program or a program
that is expected to lead to gainful employment, being the caretaker relative in the
household who is not the parent of the child or children in the assistance unit and who is
required to remain at home to care for a dependent in the assistance unit and loss of
employment by the adult following termination of TANF under this subsection.

termination.
