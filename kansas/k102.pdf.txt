Chairman Hawkins and Members of the House Health and Human Services Committee, thank you
for this opportunity to provide testimony. My name is Steve Denny. I currently serve as Director
of Clinical Services at Four County Mental Health Center located in Independence, KS. I am a
Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a Licensed Clinical Addictions Counselor.
I am testifying on behalf of the Kansas Association of Addiction Professionals (KAAP), the state‘s
sole trade association dedicated to the treatment and prevention of substance use disorders. I am
here to express full support of House Bill 2106 on behalf of KAAP.

KAAP believes that House Bill 2106, if passed, to be a positive advancement for the �ield of
substance use disorder treatment in Kansas. We are seeking this bill because it will allow
nationally accredited providers through organizations such as the Commission of Accreditation of
Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) or the Joint Commission to meet state regulatory requirements
through their national accreditation. You will hear from several substance use providers who will
explain in greater detail as to how this bill would bene�it their organizations in greater detail
following my testimony.

Beyond organizational bene�its and convenience, KAAP believes that this bill to be re�lective of the
overall direction of behavioral health care. Many substance use disorder organizations are
currently providing or are looking to provide more comprehensive services to individuals
receiving care in their organizations including co-occurring mental health treatment and
psychiatric services. Integrated primary care is also recognized as a future option in the �ield.
National accreditation creates a platform for more organizations to develop services to meet the
needs of individuals in a more integrated cost-effective framework with fewer duplicative
regulatory processes.

We are seeking this change in law after the 2016 legislative session when the Legislature and the
Governor approved Senate Bill 449. This bill provided the exact same authority to licensed
community mental health centers. Senate Bill 449 included very speci�ic language as requested by
the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services (KDADS) to be included in the law. In
House Bill 2106, Section 1 (b) (A and B) you will �ind the same requirements as requested by
KDADS to support the bill for community mental health centers in 2016. We concur with their
position and have included in House Bill 2106 the exact same language.
We urge your support for House Bill 2106 and passage out of committee. I am happy to stand for
questions at the appropriate time.
