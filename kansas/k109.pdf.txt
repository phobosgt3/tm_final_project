Re: H.B. 2107 â€“ Relating to the regulation of biosimilar medications
Dear Honorable Chairman Hawkins and Committee Members,
The Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations (CSRO) is a national
organization composed of approximately 35 state and regional professional
rheumatology societies. CSRO formed by physicians to ensure excellence
and access to the highest quality care for patients with rheumatologic,
autoimmune, and musculoskeletal disease.
Rheumatologists are on the forefront of treatments for patients with
autoimmune diseases. With the advent of biologic medications, we have been
able to stop the progression of some of these diseases and avoid the
development of life-long deformities. Biological products available for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases have had a
significant impact on improving our patients' quality of life, preventing
deformities, disability and lowering mortality.
As you consider H.B. 2107, CSRO wishes to convey its support for this
important legislation.
This bill provides important pathways for access to these unique medications.
It also creates much needed patient safety rules including for dispensing
pharmacists to communicate with physicians about biosimilar substitutions
within 5 days. Requiring this communication as quickly as possible provides
physicians an opportunity to counter and correctly report any adverse effects
of medications.
With FDA approval of biosimilars, biological products continue to be of
growing importance for rheumatology patients. CSRO supports the safe
introduction of interchangeable biologic drugs into the practice of medicine in
Kansas and urges the passage of H.B. 2107.
Respectfully,

Michael P. Stevens
President
Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations
