House Committee on Health and Human Services
Support of House Bill 2107- Biological products
Presented by Eric Stafford, Vice President of Government Affairs
Tuesday, January 24, 2017

Mister Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Eric Stafford, Vice
President of Government Affairs for the Kansas Chamber. The Kansas Chamber
appreciates the opportunity to testify in support of House Bill 2107 which authorizes the
ability to substitute brand name drugs with biological drugs.
Each year the Kansas Chamber conducts a survey of 300 business owners from across
the state during our legislative agenda development process to determine what issues
are of biggest concern to businesses. This year, health care costs (44%) topped taxes
(38%) as the issue business owners identified as most important to profitability to their
company.
The majority of Kansans receive their health insurance through their employers. HB
2107 is a bill that could help employers realize savings through access to a less
expensive biosimilar rather than a brand name biologic. More than 20 states have
already passed this legislation including Missouri which passed this bill by a large
margin.
We appreciate the opportunity to offer comments in support of HB 2107 which expands
competition and access to alternative biosimilar options that could help lower health
care costs for Kansas businesses.

The Kansas Chamber, with headquarters in Topeka, is the leading statewide pro-business
advocacy group moving Kansas towards becoming the best state in America to do business. The
Chamber represents small, medium and large employers all across Kansas.
