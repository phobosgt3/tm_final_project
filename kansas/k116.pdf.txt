The Honorable Daniel Hawkins
Chairman, House Health and Human Services Committee
Kansas Legislature
Topeka, Kansas
Dear Chairman Hawkins & Members of the Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony in support of House Bill 2107, which will
allow for the substitution of FDA-approved interchangeable biologics.
Express Scripts is the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits manager, providing the prescription drug
benefit for over 85 million Americans. Our company’s mission is to make the use of prescription drugs
safer and more affordable, and this legislation supports that endeavor.
Over the past several years Express Scripts has worked with the pharmaceutical manufacturing
community and other stakeholders in an attempt to broker an equitable solution on the issue of
interchangeable biologics. The results of those efforts are before you in HB 2107, with the
electronically-based communication provisions in Section 3 of the bill being a key to successfully
forging consensus and enacting this important legislation in a growing number of states.
HB 2107 will allow for a robust biosimilars market, while simultaneously protecting both patients and
payors. Enacting this bill into law will mean that Kansas’ law will be updated to permit its residents to
take full advantage of interchangeable biologics, as they become available.
The first biosimilars have been approved by the FDA. A further wave of drug products in the pipeline
that may be approved by the FDA should reduce prescription drug spending by hundreds of billions of
dollars over the next decade.
Express Scripts enthusiastically supports HB 2107 and we appreciate the Committee’s consideration
of this important measure.
