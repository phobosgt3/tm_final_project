Kansas House Health and Human Services Committee
The Honorable Dan Hawkins, Chairman
Kansas State Capitol, Room 546-S
Topeka, KS 66612
Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Health and Human Services Committee:
My name is Drue Duncan and I am Director of Government Relations for Pfizer in Kansas. I testify
before you today to urge your support of House Bill 2107.
HB 2107 simply updates the Kansas Pharmacy Practice Act to allow for the substitution of FDA
approved interchangeable biologic products. Passage will result in access to lower cost drugs for
patients throughout Kansas.
Pfizer is committed to bringing high-quality biosimilars to patients, providers and payers throughout the
United States and the world. I am proud to say that Kansas plays an integral part in this commitment.
Our manufacturing site in McPherson employs more than 1400 colleagues and plays a key role in
biosimilars manufacturing. The facility in McPherson has been manufacturing biologics for 30 years.
With an established track record in biologic manufacturing, McPherson stands poised to help Pfizer
enter the biosimilars market in the US.
Thank you for your time today and the opportunity to discuss the importance of Kansas to Pfizer.
Sincerely,

Drue Duncan
Director, US Government Relations
Pfizer Inc.
