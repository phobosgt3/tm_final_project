BIOSIMILARS AND SMALL MOLECULE
GENERICS: HOW DO THEY DIFFER AND
WHY DOES IT MATTER?

THOMAS FELIX, MD

MEDICAL DIRECTOR, R&D POLICY

WHAT IS A BIOLOGIC MEDICINE?
• A biologic is a substance that is made from a living organism or its

products.1
• Biologics are developed in living systems, including bacterial2, yeast3,4,

and mammalian5,6 cells.

A HOST CELL IS CHOSEN TO MASS PRODUCE THE PROTEIN
Cells that most effectively
produce the protein are
replicated1,2

A cell bank of master cells
are isolated and stored1,2

Some cells are used to
create a working cell bank
and are used to make the
protein of interest1,2

Each biologic starts with a cell bank designed to produce that specific protein

WHAT ARE BIOSIMILARS?



Biosimilars highly similar, but not identical to, existing biological products.1
The Public Health Service Act defines biosimilar or biosimilarity as:
• “the biological product is highly similar to the reference product
notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components,”2 and
• “there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product
and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the
product.”2

Biosimilars

FDA PERSPECTIVE: A “TOTALITY OF THE EVIDENCE”
APPROACH WILL BE APPLIED TO ASSESS BIOSIMILARITY
Generics

Extensive structural and functional characterization

Establish same active ingredient
Consider need for animal data to assess toxicity
Demonstration of bioequivalence

Clinical studies to compare PK/PD, safety/efficacy, and

Sufficient to demonstrate that the product is “highly similar” to the
reference product and safe, pure, and potent for one or more
approved conditions of use

SUMMARY






Biologics are developed in living cells1,2, using complex processes involving many
highly regulated and unique steps3-6
Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical to the innovator biologic2
The US pathway for approval of biosimilars was signed into law as part of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act7
 A totality of evidence will be considered when evaluating a biosimilar product
for approval8
 Determination of interchangeability requires a higher standard of evidence7,9
Patient care is advanced when physicians and pharmacists communicate after the
dispensing of a biologic.
