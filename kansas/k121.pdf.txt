Good afternoon Chairman Hawkins and members of the Health and Human Services
Committee. And thank you for considering this important piece of legislation.
My name is Greg Hoke. I am the Director of Government Affairs for the Biotechnology
Innovation Organization. BIO is the international trade association representing over 1,200
member companies who are involved in food, agriculture, fuel and healthcare.
I am here today to ask your support of HB 2107.
When the Federal Food and Drug Administration approved a pathway for follow-on biologic
products, they also approved a pathway for what are called “interchangeable biologics”. It is
these products which can be understood as a “generic” version of biologics. However, that’s
not really the case as true generics are exact replicas of their innovator drug.
Because biologics are made from living cells, which you will heard about shortly, they are
not exact copies of the innovator drug. And for that reason, current state substitution laws
are silent on biologic substitution. And why this legislation is necessary.
The language in HB 2107 is the result of years of work with industry, providers, pharmacy,
chain store, PBMs, and most importantly patient groups. It’s through the work of these
groups that this language was developed to allow for a pharmacist, with the physician’s
permission, to substitute potentially lower-priced, live-saving, life-changing interchangeable
biologics
HB 2107, will also will provide that both the physician and patient will know which product
they have been dispensed.
To date, 26 states, and Puerto Rico, have approved this legislation. 15 more are targeted for
2017. We look forward to the passage of HB 2107 so that Kansans will benefit from these
important drugs
Thank you.
