WRITTEN TESTIMONY
House Health and Human Services Committee
HB 2124
February 2, 2017
My name is Bob Williams, Executive Director of the Kansas Association of Osteopathic Medicine
(KAOM). Thank you for this opportunity to address the Committee regarding HB 2124 which would
expand the medical student and resident loan assistance act to include general psychiatry and child
psychiatry.
KAOM recognizes the current shortage of psychiatrist in the State of Kansas which makes it difficult for
various entities to determine and diagnose mental health illnesses. In that vein, KAOM supports
HB2124 as long as the psychiatry slots do not diminish the available slots for the other medical
disciplines identified in the act (pediatrics, internal medicine, family medicine and family practice,
emergency medicine, and fellowship training in geriatric medicine).
Do not hesitate to contact me should you have questions.
Thank you.
