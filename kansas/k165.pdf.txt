Re: Support of Dental Therapists â€“ HB 2139 (written testimony)
Dear Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Committee:
Thank you for this opportunity to provide written testimony in support of HB
2139. The Johnson County Commission on Aging advocates for over a 107,000
seniors. We are the advisory support group to the Johnson County AAA and
are appointed by the Board of County Commissioners. Our 2017 Legislative
Platform includes support of the establishment of Dental Therapists to work
under the guidance of a licensed dentist to provide services to older Kansans
The data is very clear that Kansans do not have access to dental care. This is
especially true in the more rural counties and nursing homes throughout the
state. It is also clear that providing oral care to older persons has a positive
impact on the medical condition of the individual. Heart disease, diabetes,
weight loss and other physical health problems improve with good oral care.
It is clear that seniors will benefit from HB 2139 and the establishment of
dental therapists in Kansas. Improved health and quality of life will be realized
for seniors who would be able to access dental care through the dental
therapist. As such, we support HB 2139 which would establish dental
therapists in Kansas.
Thank you for this opportunity to present written testimony and we are
pleased to support HB 2139.

Dan Goodman, Director
Respectfully yours,
Johnson County Commission on Aging
