Re: Support of Dental Therapists – HB 2139 (written testimony)
Dear Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Committee,
Thank you for this opportunity to provide written testimony in support of HB 2139. The Kansas Association of
Area Agencies on Aging and Disabilities (k4ad) represents the eleven Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). The eleven
AAAs cover all 105 Kansas counties.
The AAAs are charged by the federal Older Americans Act to serve as the public advocate for the development
or enhancement of comprehensive and coordinated community‐based systems or services in our planning areas,
with a focus on seniors.
From our perspective, seniors will benefit from HB 2139 and the establishment of dental therapists in Kansas.
The benefit will be realized for seniors residing in either a community based setting or a nursing facility. While
most seniors are covered under Medicare for their health insurance coverage, dental services are not included
as a core Medicare covered service. Supplemental policies may be available, however, the policies may or may
not be affordable for many seniors. As such, we support HB 2139 which would establish dental therapists in
Kansas.
Thank you for this opportunity to present written testimony and we are pleased to support HB 2139.
Sincerely,

Janis DeBoer
Executive Director, k4ad
