Thank you for taking the time to hear this testimony in support of House Bill 2149. My name is
Gallal Obeid, a Masters in Social Work student. As a student that received his undergraduate degree in
psychology, later working in a social psychology research laboratory and now actively working on
attaining my MSW degree, I have a unique perspective to offer. Having worked and studied in different
departments that both offer licensure I believe that social workers have a vantage point different from
other helping professions and should have the opportunity to create a committee of professional social
workers under the BSRB. I support Bill 2149 because:
ï‚· Social workers are an independent profession and are best at vetting social workers for practice.
Establishing an independent Social Work Examining Committee will ensure that social workers
are peer-reviewed by members who possess the knowledge, expertise and adherence to the code
of ethics ascribed to by its professional membership and educational accrediting body. As a
result, this committee will help to improve the quality of service provided by professional social
workers in Kansas.
My personal experiences and background have shown me the need for the Social Work Examining
Committee. The benefits of passing this bill will go beyond expanding social work as a profession and
ensuring social workers are peer-reviewed by members who understand the practice; it will also ensure
that every client served by social workers will receive services that align with consistent professional
values. This bill serves my future profession and all those I will be blessed to serve as my future
clients.
Thank you for your time and consideration. As a student invested in this state, I appreciate
proactive steps to ensure the future of Kansans such as myself and those in my community.
Sincerely,
Gallal Obeid
