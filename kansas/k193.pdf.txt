HB 2149 Testimony
February 15, 2017
House Health and Human Services
Sky Westerlund, LMSW
The Kansas Chapter, National Association of Social Workers (KNASW) is the professional association working on
behalf of the profession and practice of social work in Kansas. Social workers have been licensed at three levels of
practice since 1976. These are the baccalaureate (LBSW), the master (LMSW), and the independent clinical social
worker (LSCSW). The practice of social work is performed in many fields including adoptions, addictions, aging, child
welfare, courts and corrections, corporations and businesses, domestic violence, early childhood, hospitals and health,
hospice and palliative care, poverty prevention programs, mental health, community based prevention, problem
gambling, pre-schools and schools, trauma, veterans and military, research and teaching, and more. We work in both
the public and private sectors of the economy.
There are more than 7,400 social workers licensed to practice in Kansas. In fact, social workers are the largest group of
mental health providers in Kansas, serving thousands every day. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of
Labor Statistics, our profession is anticipated to grow by 12% from 2014 –2024. This is very good news for the
profession and the Kansas communities we serve, as well as the Kansas economy.
Unfortunately, the current system of licensing and regulating social workers has not kept pace with this
growth. That is why KNASW strongly supports HB 2149.
The Behavioral Sciences Regulatory Board (BSRB) composite board currently licenses and regulates social workers in
Kansas. It was organized in 1980 to regulate two professions: psychology and social work. Now it regulates seven
disciplines. With 7,463 licensed social workers, we are by far the largest group under the BSRB, numbering about 58%
of all licensees. Social work is also the fastest growing mental health workforce in Kansas. In 2016, the agency
licensed 569 new social workers. The other six disciplines combined gained 393 new licensees. However, despite our
numbers, social workers are not well represented on the BSRB composite board, holding only two of the 12 seats.
This means that social workers and the people we serve are subject to decisions made by those who are not trained
social workers.
Poor representation on the board can have bad outcomes. For example, several years ago the BSRB approved
granting a master social work license to an individual who had a record of five felonies —including first-degree murder.
The board voted against the recommendations of the two social workers on the board. This decision undermined one
of the core principles of the Kansas Social Workers Licensure Act: “…to protect the public by setting standards of
qualification, training and experience for those who seek to engage in the practice of social work…” It underscores
how far removed social workers have become from the decisions that affect our profession and the vulnerable people
we work with everyday.
HB 2149 seeks to give social workers our voice in upholding the professional standards and responsibilities that our
profession demands and our clients deserve. It establishes a new Social Work Examining Committee within the
Behavioral Sciences Regulatory Board. The BSRB—as an agency—already provides the administrative support for
social work licensure. It would continue to do so. It would continue to collect and deposit the licensure fees in the
established fee fund for the agency. About $500,000 is collected from social workers every year.

To be clear, this legislation has no impact on the state budget or the State General Fund. We as social workers
pay for the privilege of being licensed to practice in the state of Kansas. In fact, 10% of social work licensure fees go
into the State General Fund.
HB 2149 will change who makes the public protection decisions for licensed social workers. The Social Work
Examining Committee will be comprised of five social workers and two public members. The committee will be
responsible for regulating the practice of social work and the licensing of social workers, including addressing problem
applications or renewals, resolving complaints, approval of clinical supervision training plans, and development of rules
and regulations, including continuing education requirements.
We are confident that the Social Work Examining Committee, through the peer-review process, will enhance
public protection of the thousands of people served by social workers. It will achieve this goal without disrupting
the current BSRB budget or interfering with the other six professions served by the BSRB. The composite BSRB board
will remain to represent their interests.
KNASW asks for your support of HB 2149.
