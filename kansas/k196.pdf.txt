MEMORANDUM

DATE: February 2, 2017
TO: House Federal and State Affairs Committee
FROM: Travis Couture-Lovelady, NRA State Liaison
RE: HB 2150
Chairman Barker, members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to address
you this morning on an issue important to NRA members and gun owners throughout Kansas. I
am here today on behalf of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action to
express our opposition to HB 2150.

The National Rifle Association strongly supported the 2013 public buildings law and
agreed to the compromise that allowed for a four year exemption for those that asked for
additional time to prepare. On July 1, 2017 that time period ends and the law goes into effect.

The underlying reasoning behind the change is simple. If it cannot be guaranteed with a
reasonable amount of certainty by placing metal detectors, armed guards, etc. at the entrance
points that there are no firearms inside a building, then that building must allow concealed carry.
If the building cannot disarm those seeking to do harm then they cannot disarm the law-abiding
citizen.

Under the law, if metal detectors and armed security are at building entrances, firearms
are not allowed. Firearms are also prohibited in areas that can only be accessed with security
badges or restricted passcodes, such as labs. Creating or maintaining “gun free zones” only
puts law abiding citizens in danger.

On behalf of the National Rifle Association I respectfully request your opposition to HB 2150.

Thank you for your consideration.
