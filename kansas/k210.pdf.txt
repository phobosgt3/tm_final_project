Chairman Hawkins and members of the House Committee on Health and Human Services:
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today in support of HB 2169. I am here on
behalf of the KanCare Advocates Network (KAN). KAN is a coalition of advocates whose
collective interests include issues impacting children and adults who are served by KanCare
under the Kansas Medicaid program.
Among its activities, KAN has tracked and documented the financial strain KanCare has placed
on providers of services of both long term supports and services and medical care. As part of that
effort, we hosted three public forums across the state in May, July and October and heard from at
least 500 individuals, families and providers.
Representatives from across the provider network spoke at those meetings. They all expressed
frustrations with delayed and incorrect reimbursements and burdensome administrative
processes. They also were concerned about their inability to access information about the people
for whom they care. They also spoke about the need for a uniform credentialing process and
consistent and timely communications between providers and managed care organizations. This
bill addresses those concerns as well as providing the opportunity for an independent, third-party
external review on appeal.
The success of KanCare depends upon a healthy and robust provider network. That network is
the bedrock of KanCareâ€™s goal of improving the health outcomes for recipients. SB 69 provides
stability, uniformity and consistency to administrative processes, ultimately improving their
ability to care for their patients.
KAN urges you to support HB 2169.
Sincerely,
Sean Gatewood
KanCare Advocates Network
