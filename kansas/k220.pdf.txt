Testimony re: HB 2195
House Health and Human Services Committee
Presented by Ronald R. Hein
on behalf of
Kansas Hearing Aid Association
February 13, 2017
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:
My name is Ron Hein, and I am legislative counsel for the Kansas Hearing Society (KHS). KHS is
the professional association for licensed hearing aid dispensers and dispensing audiologists in the
state.
Today I would like to share my knowledge about how efficient the Kansas Board of Examiners of
Hearing Instruments Dispensers is. When I served on senate Ways and Means, I had the
opportunity to chair the sub-committee which reviewed the budget of the then Board of Hearing Aid
Examiners. In 1981-4, their budget was approximately $6,000-7,000. FY2018, their budget is
approximately $26,000. In 1984, the Board of Healing Arts budget was $311,000, and in FY 2018,
the Board of Healing Arts budget is more than $5 million. In 1984, the SGF budget was $1.5
billion. I am not criticizing the Board of Healing Arts, but I do believe that the Board of Hearing
Aid Examiners is one of the most, if not the most, efficient agencies in Kansas state government.
If the board had been under a large state agency as proposed by HB 2195 over the years, I believe
their budget would be substantially higher than $26,000. As with all fee boards, there is no SGF
dollars in their budget, and they actually pay the SGF 10% of their budget as do all fee boards.
So since there are no taxpayers dollars in this budget, then the intent of HB 2195 is not to create
efficiency for taxpayersâ€™ money. And, in fact, it will not create any efficiency. The regulated
licensees who pay the fees for the Board monitor such fees closely, and demand efficiency.
Ironically, it costs money every time a bill is introduced, with costs assigned to bill introductions in
the past. I imagine it costs the state more to print/process this bill than the agency budget. This bill
is not about efficiency. What is the motives of HB 2195. Why move a small ,efficient, effective
agency to a large, arguably more bureaucratic agency? Others will address their views on the
motives for this bill. This bill does nothing but one thing..move an unbelievably efficient agency
into a larger state agency. It improves nothing, but threatens both hearing aid dispensers and the
public served by this profession,
Thank you very much for permitting me to testify, and I will be happy to yield to questions.
