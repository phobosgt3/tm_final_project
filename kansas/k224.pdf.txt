HB 2195 Testimony from John Ferraro, PhD, FASHA, FAA, ASHA Honor
Good afternoon. My name is John Ferraro and I have been Professor and Chair of the Hearing and
Speech Department at the KU Medical Center and Co-Director of the KU Intercampus Program in
Communicative Disorders for the past 33 years. It has been my privilege to serve on the KDADS Advisory
Board in Speech-Language Pathology/Audiology since 2012. Iâ€™m here to speak in support of HB 2195. To
me, the most impressive aspect of what our advisory board does is protecting the public. During my
tenure, we have dealt with such items as fraudulent advertising, inappropriate applications for
credentialing, and complaints from both public and private sectors about services related to speechlanguage-hearing health care. The Board comprises a diverse array of professionals, again from public
and private sectors, whose role is to help the Department deal with issues in the most objective and fair
manner, where expertise is of paramount importance, and in a way that protects both the professionals
who provide services in speech-language pathology and audiology in Kansas, and the individuals who
receive these services. The Board runs smoothly, licensure is well-managed, and oversight by the Board
provides consumers the necessary protection we would expect and deserve from a licensing agency.
In addition, and from my interactions with the KDADS staff, this bill does not jeopardize the profession
of Hearing Instrument Specialist, nor are the businesses of these professionals threatened by any aspect
of it. KDADS serves to protect consumers from harm, and supports the professionals it licenses. I'm
confident that the Department will provide the same level and quality of oversight to hearing
instrument specialists as it does for speech-language pathologists and audiologists.
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to voice my support for HB 2195
