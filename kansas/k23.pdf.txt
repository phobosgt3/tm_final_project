NAMI Kansas is the state organization of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a grassroots
organization whose members are individuals living with mental illnesses and their family members
who provide care and support. NAMI Kansas provides programs of peer support and education by
and for our members through a statewide network of 13 local affiliates. We advocate for individuals
who are living with mental illness to ensure their access to treatment and supportive services.
We urge you to support HB 2031.
We support efforts to improve quality of life for Kansans living with mental illness though palliative
care. Individuals and families living with mental illness need support to address not only the side
effects of illness and treatment, but also socioemotional, spiritual and other challenges. The advisory
council on palliative care can identify ways to improve access to supportive care for families facing
any type of serious illness, including mental illness. The palliative care consumer and professional
education program will ensure that patients, caregivers and health care providers understand the
opportunities available through palliative care.
Supporting quality of life for families facing mental illness through patient-centered and family
focused palliative care will enable Kansans living with mental illness to enjoy better quality of life
and contribute to their communities.
Thank you for your consideration.
