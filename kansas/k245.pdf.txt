HB 2206 is designed to and does establish parity between in-person and telemedicinedelivered health care services and providers.
We are living in the electronic age. Telemedicine is not just watching a video. It is
interactive. Telecommunications are here to stay.
Telemedicine is real-time, face-to-face interaction with real health care providers.
Research shows students who receive Teletherapy services have done better or equal to
those who have received in-person services.
A provider who delivers health care services through the use of telemedicine maintains
the same licensure and certification standards as providers of in-person services.
Therapy services are reimbursable when conducted in person in a school.
Therapy services provided through in-person consultations or through telemedicine or
telehealth should be treated as equivalent services for purposes of reimbursement;
According to an article from the Mayo Clinic, the National Department of Health and
Human Services has included greater use of technology as one of its Healthy People 2020
objectives for improving the health of all Americans.
It is just common sense to utilize telehealth to create parity among the many diverse
districts in Kansas.

On behalf of the Kansas Association of Special Education Administrators, I strongly encourage
you to move forward with HB 2206 today.
