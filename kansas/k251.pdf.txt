Testimony to the House Health and Human Services Committee
In Support of HB2217 â€“ Emergency Opioid Antidotes
February 7, 2017
Chairman Hawkins and Committee Members,
Our associations strongly support HB2217. The bill proposes a procedure for allowing first
responders to have access to these drugs which counter opioid overdoses. We will let others with
medical expertise explain the medical applications and safety of these drugs. Many states already
allow first responders to have access to these drugs and administer them to those experiencing
opioid overdoses. There are numerous stories of lives saved because of those actions.
Kansas has not yet experienced the horrific levels of opioid overdoses that have been seen in
other states. To be clear, we have seen opioid overdoses and deaths in Kansas, just not in the
numbers other states have seen. But it is increasing and this bill prepares us to be able to respond.
In December of last year nine people died of heroin overdoses in Philadelphia over one weekend.
In August of 2016, there were 174 reported heroin overdoses over a six day period in Cincinnati.
A June 3, 2016, KSNT (Topeka) news reported on deaths already occurring in Kansas from a
synthetic opioid known as U-47700. Over a one week period over this past Christmas, Shawnee
County experienced at least 9 heroin overdoses. Prescription opioid abuses also lead to
overdoses.
We have an opportunity to prepare our first responders to save lives with this bill.
We strongly encourage you to move this bill favorably.
