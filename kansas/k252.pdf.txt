To: Kansas House Committee on Health and Human Services
Re: Support for HB 2217
From: Kansas Emergency Medical Services Association (KEMSA), Brandon Beck, President
Date: February 7, 2017
The Kansas Emergency Medical Services Association (KEMSA) is the professional association
representing the paramedics, EMTs and ambulance services serving the citizens of Kansas.
KEMSA works on various regulatory and legislative matters as well as conferences and
educational programs.
KEMSA supports the passage of HB 2217.
HB 2217 will provide needed policy to allow for the expanded use of opioid antagonists, which
have proven successful in many other states as an emergency response to the national opioid
epidemic. While currently Kansas is not suffering to the same magnitude of the opioid epidemic,
HB 2217 will allow a greater number of personnel such as law enforcement, school nurses, and bystanders to administer this life saving medication.
KEMSA recognizes the potential benefit of HB 2217 and appreciates that the various groups that
have worked together to bring forward HB 2217 represent the wide range of professionals that is
necessary to have a successful effort. Physicians, pharmacists, EMS, law enforcement, school
nurses and others have all worked on this effort. We expect to use this same collaboration in
order to implement HB 2217 upon its passage.
We encourage you to support passage of HB 2217.
Sincerely,

Brandon Beck
President
Kansas EMS Association (KEMSA)
