From: MARCER, Tom Collins, Chairman
RE: Support for HB 2217
Date: February 2, 2017
Mid- America Regional Council (MARC) is the bi-state council of local governments serving nine
area counties in the KS/MO area of Kansas City. MARC has a sub-committee regarding
emergency medical services, (MARCER) consisting of over 35 area EMS agencies and 20
hospitals which collaborate through MARCER for various issues such as communications,
disaster planning, hospital diversion, TCD, group purchasing and numerous policy initiatives.
MARCER supports the passage of HB 2217.
The provision to allow a greater segment of our community to use Naloxone to assist a patient
suffering from an Opioid Overdose is a critical change in state law. In many areas of the nation
the opioid epidemic is claiming thousands of lives a year. Almost every state has adjusted the
necessary state laws in order to allow police officers, school nurses and as proposed in Kansas,
bystanders to use Naloxone to treat those having an overdose.
HB 2217 was prepared by a coalition including the KS Pharmacists Association, KS Board of
Pharmacy, KS Medical Society, KS Board of Healing Arts, KS Police Chiefs Assoc, KS Sheriffs
Assoc, KS Peace Officers Assoc, KBI, KS Emergency Medical Services Assoc, MARCER, KS Poison
Control at KU, numerous KS EMS physicians and several law enforcement agencies. The effort
was to develop a widely supported bill that built on the success in many other states.
HB 2217, we believe is sound public policy and will serve to save the lives of many Kansanâ€™s and
we urge you to support the legislation.
