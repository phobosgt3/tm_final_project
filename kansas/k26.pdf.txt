Re: Support of Quality of Life Bill – HB 2031 (written testimony)
Dear Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Committee,
Thank you for this opportunity to provide written testimony in support of HB 2031. The Kansas Association of
Area Agencies on Aging and Disabilities (k4ad) represents the eleven Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). The eleven
AAAs cover all 105 Kansas counties.
The AAAs are charged by the federal Older Americans Act to serve as the public advocate for the development
or enhancement of comprehensive and coordinated community-based systems or services in our planning areas,
with a focus on seniors and their caregivers.
From our perspective, seniors and their caregivers will benefit from HB 2031 and the establishment of an expert
advisory council on palliative care and quality of life. This task force could identify ways to support expanded
access to palliative care as well as explore challenges and opportunities related to palliative care delivery, which
we support. The bill also establishes a palliative care education program through KDHE to help educate the
public and health care providers about palliative care.
We are pleased to support HB 2031.
Sincerely,

Janis DeBoer
Executive Director, k4ad
