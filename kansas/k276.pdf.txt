Kansas State Board of Nursing

Sam Brownback, Governor

Health and Human Services Committee
January 31, 2018
Testimony in Support of House Bill 2496
Carol Moreland, MSN, R.N.
Executive Administrator
Good Afternoon Chairman Hawkins and members of the Health and Human Services Committee. My
name is Carol Moreland, Executive Administrator of the Kansas State Board of Nursing (KSBN). I am
here to provide testimony for HB 2496 with the following areas of concern from the Board of Nursing.
The Board of Nursing was developed in 1913. The mission of the Board of Nursing is to assure the
citizens of Kansas safe and competent practice by nurses and mental health technicians through licensure
and regulations of Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, four roles of Advance Practice
Registered Nurses, and Licensed Mental Health Technicians. There are eleven Board members
appointed by the Governor. KSBN is the largest health care fee funded board with approximately 72,000
active licensees and receives no state general funds.
KSBN licenses RNs and LPNs to practice nursing within Kansas. Presently there are 58,034 RNs and
10,007 LPNs licensed in Kansas. If nurses licensed in Kansas wish to practice nursing in another state
they must get licensed in that state. The nurse licensure compact (NLC) is the licensure model that
allows registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to have one multistate license, with
the privilege to practice in the home state and in other NLC states physically, electronically, and/or
telephonically. There are presently 29 states that are part of the NLC. Kansas is not currently in the
NLC. Nurses seeking licensure in any state that is part of the NLC must meet eleven uniform licensure
requirements. HB 2496 would allow Kansas to join the NLC and issue multi-state licenses for RNs and
LPNs.
HB 2496 is a standard NLC model legislation template that many of the 29 states utilized as a foundation
for further developing state-specific bill language. The Board of Nursing was not provided the
opportunity to review HB 2496 and give feedback before it was introduced. As it is currently drafted, it
lacks information specific to Kansas that we request be included in the bill to address the following areas:
1. Revenue loss: If Kansas joins the NLC, there are significant fiscal and areas of operational
impacts for the Board of Nursing. The Board of Nursing is a fee funded agency. Presently the
Board of Nursing receives revenue from licensees who reside within the Kansas boarders as well
as those outside our boarders who want to practice nursing within Kansas. If Kansas were to join
the NLC, the Board of Nursing will only receive revenues derived from licensees who reside
within Kansas. It is estimated the Board of Nursing will lose $367,170.00 from nurses who reside
within the 29 states that are members of the NLC and are presently licensed in Kansas. This
revenue loss will increase as more states join the NLC. It is estimated the recurring revenue loss
of licenseesâ€™ fees will be $534,120.00 annually.
2. Implementation costs: If Kansas joins the NLC, there are significant implementation costs. There
is an annual membership fee to join the NLC. Communication costs include notification to
licensees, employers, permanent residence verification and stakeholder meetings.

Communication will be very important so all nurses, employers and the public are aware of the
changes and how it will impact them. Our current licensing information system will need to be
enhanced and revised to articulate with the compact national data system. The cost included in
our fiscal impact note is an estimated enhancement cost based on other states that use the same
licensure system and have joined the NLC. There will be a recurring annual maintenance cost.
Data integrity costs include the need for two part-time temporary staff (without benefits) to
review existing information, cleanse any inconsistent or outdated information within our database
that encompasses over 125,000+ records, change records after review from single to multistate
licenses, process criminal history reports, data entry of permanent residence and document
scanning. We will need an additional investigator due to a projected increase in number of
investigations as compact nurses transition in and out of Kansas. The estimated cost for this
salary is $76,046.00 (with benefits) annually. With the agency office at maximum occupancy, we
will need to do some remodeling in our agency to accommodate the extra staff. This remodeling
cost has been submitted for cost estimates, but is currently unknown. The estimated
implementation expenditures will be $332,546.00, excluding any needed remodeling. The Board
of Nursing is applying for one-time grant funds from our national organization that administers
the NLC to cover at least a portion of all the implementation and data integrity costs, but receipt
of soft funding is always uncertain. The Board of Nursing will request an increase in our
appropriations to cover some or all the implementation costs if grant funds are not available.
Even with a grant, there will need to be a change in appropriations for the recurring costs of
$107,046.00 to cover annual member fee, annual maintenance agreement and the additional
investigator.
3. Statutory caps on licensure fees: The Board of Nursing is close to or at the statutory caps on
licensure fees for RN and LPN (initial, endorsement and biennial renewal) per K.S.A. 65-1118.
The nursing licensure fees have not been raised for several years. Renewal licensure fees for RNs
and LPNs were decreased in 2015 and are generally lower than most of the other states. The
Board of Nursing has a history of fiscal accountability by keeping the licensure fees as low as
possible for the licensee while maintaining the financial stability of the agency. The Board of
Nursing will need to determine the amount licensure fees must be raised to make up the initial and
recurring revenue loss if Kansas joins the NLC. Implicit in that decision is consideration for the
additional financial burden placed on nurses, particularly rural nurses who do not earn high
salaries.
4. Implementation timeline: The Board of Nursing will need to extend the implementation timeline
on the bill to ensure that all operational and IT changes can occur without major disruptions to the
licensure and regulatory processes for nurse. Major disruptions in licensure or discipline would,
of course, negatively impact health service provision quality and access. The Board of Nursing
has significant concerns that our historically stellar service would deteriorate should the state
level IT consolidation occur and apply to the Board in the near future. We will need to maintain
experienced IT staff within our agency to ensure implementation proceeds smoothly. Inadequate
time or inadequate IT staff to implement smoothly can negatively impact nurses, employers and
most importantly, the citizens of Kansas.
The Board of Nursing voted in December 2017 to proceed with joining the compact and was planning on
introducing legislation in January 2019 after they carefully examined the significant fiscal and
operational impact. The Board of Nursing has scheduled a special Board meeting on February 1, 2018 to
discuss in detail the above information and will be submitting amendments to HB 2496 that address their
concerns. The board respectfully asks that the Board be allowed to bring amendments forward after their
special Board meeting. Thank you for your time and consideration and I will stand for questions.
