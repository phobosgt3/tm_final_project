House Bill 2496 – Nurse Licensure Compact

The Kansas Hospital Association (KHA) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in support of House
Bill 2496. This legislation would allow registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) the
ability to hold a multistate license and practice nursing not only in Kansas, but also in twenty-nine other states
that have joined a nurse licensure compact.
A multistate license would benefit RNs and LPNs who wish to be employed as travelling nurses. The ability to
work in a compact state for several weeks or months as a travelling nurse is popular with millennial nurses and
those seeking challenges in different locations. Nurses living near the border of a compact state and wishing to
live in Missouri, or Oklahoma and work in Kansas could do so by obtaining a multistate license and thus
expedite the process to practice in another state.
All compact states require that persons holding the privilege to practice nursing in their state undergo
fingerprinting federal background checks, have no felony convictions, and have not been convicted of a
misdemeanor involving patient care.
Times have changed and Kansas has provided physicians and attorneys the flexibility to practice in other states
without going through the complex and time-consuming process of obtaining another license from scratch.
Multistate licenses permit these workers the flexibility to work in other states without starting the licensure
process anew. It is time to add RNs and LPNs to this list.
Thank you for your consideration of our comments.
