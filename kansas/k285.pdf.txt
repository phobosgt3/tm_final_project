RE: Testimony HB 2496
Thank you, Chairman Hawkins, to this committee for the opportunity to testify as a
proponent for HB 2496.
Under the eNLC, nurses are able to provide care to patients in other eNLC states
without having to obtain additional licenses. Nurses with an original NLC multistate
license will be grandfathered into the eNLC. New applicants residing in compact states
will need to meet all uniform licensure requirements. Those who do not meet the new
licensure requirements may still be eligible for a single state license.

It will help out border counties who need nurses to have better access to
recruitment.
Extended online training is free to those to belong to the compact.
This creates more opportunities and versatility for Kansas nurses through
international communications for nursing education patient care.
