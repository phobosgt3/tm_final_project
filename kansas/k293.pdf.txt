Testimony Before the
House Health and Human Services Committee
By
The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy
February 1, 2018

Mister Chairman and Members of the Committee:
The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) thanks you for the
opportunity to provide testimony on House Bill 2512. AAMFT represents the
professional interests of over 62,000 Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) in the
United States. MFTs diagnose and treat mental disorders using a holistic and systemic
philosophy. AAMFT is affiliated with the Kansas Association for Marriage and Family
Therapy. AAMFT supports passage of House Bill 2512 as introduced.
House Bill 2512 would allow licensed mental health professionals and physicians to
utilize telemedicine technology to deliver healthcare services to patients at a distant site.
Telemedicine plays a crucial role in increasing access to healthcare services,
particularly mental health services, in areas where practitioners are few. In addition to
increasing access to healthcare service, telemedicine can reduce healthcare costs and
improve outcomes by allowing patients to be treated earlier and reducing barriers to
care. In rural areas, patients may be forced to travel long distances and may face long
waits in order to receive treatment.
AAMFT urges your support of House Bill 2512 as introduced, and appreciates your
consideration on this issue. Please feel free to contact Laura Evans, AAMFT
Government Relations Manager, at levans@aamft.org or via phone at 703-253-0453 if
you need additional information or have any questions.
