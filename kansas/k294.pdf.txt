This letter is written on behalf of the Kansas Counseling Association (KCA). The KCA represents
professional counselors throughout the State of Kansas serving in various professional settings. As
a branch of the American Counseling Association (ACA), KCA is committed to the ethical practice
of telemedicine (distance counseling) as outlined in the 2014 ACA Code of Ethics. The ACA Code
of Ethics addresses the ethical mandate professional counselors must follow to provide competent
and ethical telemedicine (distance counseling) services.

The practice of telemedicine (distance counseling) continues to evolve and many practitioners have
taken advantage of the opportunity to serve a wider range of clientele. Kansas, being a rural state,
has many citizens who are unable to access services due to distance or have limited options for
behavioral health providers due to their location. The establishment of the Kansas telemedicine act
provides expectations for practitioners who desire to practice distance counseling by establishing
legal requirements, which require providers to align with existing privacy laws and professional
best practices. The provisions in HB 2512 align with several ethical expectations from the ACA,
which include but are not limited to the following:
• Proper credentialing,
• Maintenance of records
• Technology and practice location expectations,
• Adherence to confidentiality/privacy practice in accordance with state and federal law, and
• Emergency procedures
Professional counselors recognize that the therapeutic relationship is no longer limited to face-toface, in-person interactions, and that advances in technology offer new opportunities to reach the
public. The Kansas Counseling Association supports the provisions in HB 2512 so long as
Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC’s) and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselors
(LCPC’s) remain included in the bill as currently stated under the Kansas Behavioral Sciences
Regulatory Board provision for Licensed Mental Healthcare Professionals. The passage of HB
2512 would afford many Kansas residents access to quality healthcare services on par with inperson mental health services and would enhance consumer protection by establishing standards for
telemedicine services.
Respectfully submitted,
Kristin Wright
