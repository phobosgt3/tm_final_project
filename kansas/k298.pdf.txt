Testimony to House Committee on Health and Human Services
Chair, Rep. Daniel Hawkins
Hearing: Thursday, February 1, 2018, 1:30 pm, Room 546-S

Position – OPPOSE HB 2512 as written
Chair Hawkins, and Members of the Committee,
As part of its mission, the MainStream Coalition supports and advocates for
healthy communities. We are excited about the prospect of a Kansas
telemedicine effort. A program such as this would offer quality health care to
many Kansans who would otherwise go without, especially in rural
communities.
This is why we were disappointed to discover in Section 6 of HB 2512 as
introduced, a restriction on providing care around women’s reproductive
health.

Abortion is a legal medical procedure in Kansas. There are no other
procedures or topics explicitly banned in HB 2512. It would appear that
Section 6 was included from a moral and religious position, not a legal or
medical one. MainStream strongly opposes legislating moral or religious
positions, as it runs counter to the separation of church and state woven into
the fabric of our nation.
As written, MainStream opposes HB 2512.
Thank you,
