House Health and Human Services Committee
February 1, 2018
HB 2512-Neutral Testimony

Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Committee,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony on HB 2512.
Because of the sad fact that abortion is treated as a "health service," this telemedicine bill must not be allowed to
ignore or undermine legal abortion restrictions.
At this time, Kansans for Lifeâ€™s position on the bill is neutral, and contingent on the following language changes
being adopted:
1.

2.

To avoid any unintended consequences, delete the wording in red from Sec. 6: Nothing in this act shall be
construed to authorize the prescription of any abortifacient, nor shall anything in Kansas telemedicine act
be construed to authorize the delivery of any abortion procedure via telemedicine.
Add the following language: The provisions of this act shall not be severable. If any provision of this
act, the Kansas telemedicine act and amendments thereto, is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by
court order, all provisions of the act, the Kansas telemedicine act and amendments thereto, shall be null
and void.

These changes are needed; otherwise, HB 2512 will create a right to medication abortion through telemedicine
that violates existent law.
Although still awaiting judicial review, the state comprehensive abortion licensure law of 2011 requires in-person
physician delivery of medications that cause abortion. The provision was further legally clarified in 2015
(http://kslegislature.org/li_2016/b2015_16/measures/documents/hb2228_enrolled.pdf) to accommodate
exceptions for emergency conditions, particularly hospitalizations.
Furthermore, the dangers of abortifacient (abortion-causing) drugs have not waned over the past seven years
since passage of state law barring the obtaining of abortion pills without physician examination and delivery.
Our parent organization, National Right to Life, has consistently exposed that the removal of physician "in person"
involvement with obtaining "medication" abortion employs significantly unreliable and incomplete data. See:
