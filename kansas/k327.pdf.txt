HB 2573 establishing the Maternal Mortality Review Committee

The Kansas Medical Society appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in
support of HB 2573, establishing the maternal mortality review committee.
Currently, due to concerns regarding legal action, we do not have maternal mortality
review allowing practitioners to evaluate those factors contributing to maternal
mortality.
Currently, physicians who voluntarily review maternal mortality cases are not
protected from being sued in any related legal action. The potential threat of legal
action associated with having simply reviewed a case creates a significant barrier to
providing this beneficial clinical review. HB 2573 rectifies this problem by
establishing legal protections for participating physicians. Additionally, the bill
protects patient information by ensuring it is de-identified and aggregated. The
committee does not have authority to revoke practitioner privileges.
By establishing these protections, the maternal mortality review committee will be
equipped to identify contributing causes and established trends as well as to make
recommendations to hospitals, physicians and other medical providers and facilities
about the findings to improve patient care and outcomes.
HB 2573 establishes necessary legal protections to encourage provider
participation, protects patient and provider information and will facilitate the
evaluation of maternal mortality, and hopefully serve to reduce its rate in Kansas.
We respectfully request your support of HB 2573.
