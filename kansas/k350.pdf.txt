Chairman Hawkins and members of the committee, I am Kimberly Steves, Director of the Radiation Control
Program at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Thank you for the opportunity to provide
testimony in support of HB 2600, an act relating to the maximum radioactive materials licensing fees and
modifying the fee structure for licensee’s with noncontiguous sites.
Kansas is an Agreement State. This means that Kansas has entered into an Agreement with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) which gives us the authority to license and inspect radioactive material used or
possessed within our state. Kansas works under the oversight of the NRC. To continue our program we
must remain compatible with the federal program, and we receive periodic audits and inspections by the NRC.
There are many benefits to our state from being an Agreement State. Examples of the benefits include:
 Facilities which possess and use radioactive material are able to work directly with Kansas Radiation
Control staff rather than federal NRC staff.
 The Kansas radioactive materials license fees are considerably lower than if the facilities were paying
the fees to the NRC.
 Kansas staff are in closer proximity and able to respond to incidents involving the licensed material and
provide assistance in a more timely manner, as the closest NRC staff are located in Arlington, TX.
 Kansas is able to maintain an increased number of qualified health physicists and radiation scientists
on staff, which provides more expertise for any type of radiological incident or emergency, whether
related to licensed material or other, which occurs in our state.
This bill includes a maximum fee increase of approximately 35% in all fee categories. This provision
does not have a fiscal impact on the budget because actual fees are set in regulation and KDHE does not

plan to raise the fees in regulation at this time. We are requesting the maximum fees to be raised because
the actual fees as set in regulation are currently near the maximum. Our last fee increase went into effect
in 2013 and was at that time estimated to be sufficient for five years. We have reached that five year
estimate, and a future increase in regulatory fees may be needed to maintain the program.
This bill also includes provisions to change the method of charging radioactive materials license fees to
those facilities which have multiple sites of use. This bill adds an additional 50% of the license fee to each
additional site of use. We believe this is an equitable method to add needed financial support to our
program because:

Kansas radioactive materials license writers spend a large amount of time in license work, including an
overall review of all the provisions of the license, working with the licensee to obtain all needed
documentation, and making regular license amendments. For those licenses which involve radioactive
materials at multiple sites, the licensing time is increased. The current license fee does not support the
costs associated with writing these type of licenses.
For those licenses with multiple sites of use, Kansas radioactive materials inspectors spend a larger
amount travel money and time traveling to various sites where radioactive materials are used for
inspections. In the cases of hospitals with satellite medical facilities across the state, the additional
travel time could be measured in days. The current license fee does not support the costs associated
with inspecting these type of licenses.
Currently a small business with just one location of use is paying the same fee for their radioactive
materials license as a large facility with multiple sites of use, and this is not equitable. The inequity
continues to increase as facilities merge and multiple licenses become one single license. However,
the KDHE work load does not decrease, though the fees we receive do decrease.

When we compare the option of modifying the radioactive materials license fee structure as described in
this bill with an across the board raising of all license fees, this is clearly a more equitable solution.
Attached to this testimony are two tables for your information. One table summarizes the impact of our
proposal to our radioactive materials licensees, showing that at this time 48 out of 270 total licenses have
multiple sites of use, and that the total increase in fees from this proposal would be $85,015, with an
average fee increase of $1,771. The second table shows a comparison of current license fees for some of
our more typical types of radioactive materials licenses between Kansas and some of our neighboring
states. This second table also shows the comparable fees charged by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
which you will see are considerably higher. Many states also have additional fees for license applications,
license amendments, and license inspections. Kansas does not charge fees for any of those categories.
In our KDHE radiation control programs, we are completely self-sufficient financially through fees and grants. I
feel strongly that we are good stewards of our money, and that we do excellent work to ensure the safety of
Kansans from the beneficial use of radioactive materials. We must, however, be able to recoup our costs,
and maintain our current level of services. An increase in the radioactive materials fee structure as described
in this bill will help us to do that in a fair and equitable way. The alternative to our radioactive materials
licensing program is for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take it over, and I guarantee you that our
radioactive materials licensees do not want that.
Thank you for consideration of HB2600.
