Health and Human Services Committee
March 6, 2018
Room 546-S; 1:30pm
Testimony for HB 2663 – KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman Act
Kerrie Bacon, KanCare Ombudsman

Chairman Hawkins and Representatives,
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on HB 2663. This bill provides for changes to the KanCare
Ombudsman’s office that reflect the input from KanCare stakeholders which include KanCare
members, community-based organizations, legislators and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS).
First, I would like to clarify the difference between the KanCare Ombudsman and the Long-Term
Care LTC) Ombudsman. The KanCare Ombudsman works with all KanCare beneficiaries and
enrollees (approximately 420,000). That sometimes includes people from nursing facilities; but
only regarding KanCare/Medicaid. The Long-Term Care Ombudsman assists individuals residing
in nursing facilities that have more administrative concern and help them with resolving those
concerns with the nursing facility and their representatives. We may refer people to the LTC
Ombudsman’s office and they, in turn, refer people with Medicaid issues to our office.
Second, in response to stakeholder input, the bill addresses three areas of concern:
1. There has been discussion about perceived and/or real conflict with the Ombudsman’s
office residing within KDADS; that there may be influence over the activities of the
Ombudsman’s office. This bill will move the KanCare Ombudsman’s office out of KDADS to
be attached to the Department of Administration as an independent agency.
2. There is concern from CMS and stakeholders that the Ombudsman’s office is not staffed at
a level appropriate to meet beneficiary and enrollee needs. There is a plan to add two fulltime staff to replace the part-time staff and increase the capacity of the office.
3. There has been concern that the Ombudsman’s office needs to provide more attention to
the grievance, appeal and hearing process. The additional staff, as Volunteer
Coordinators, will be responsible for increasing the volunteer base to include volunteers
who would focus on assisting with the grievance, appeal and hearing process.
Third, regarding the specifics on the bill:
1. Attaches the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman’s office to the Department of Administration
as a separate agency. (Sect. 2, page 2)
2. Lays out the general duties and responsibilities of the Ombudsman’s office based on the
CMS Special Terms and Conditions for providing services to KanCare/Medicaid recipients
and enrollees. (Sect 5, page 6)
3. Provides for access to documents and records for the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman’s
office. (Sect 6, page 7)

4. Creates a special revenue fund for the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman’s office. This
section does not determine where the funds or fees will be coming from but it allows for
that to be an option. (Sect 8, page 8)
5. Provides for protections for KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman office employees and
beneficiaries or people assisting them. (Sect 9, page 9)
Fourth, the Ombudsman’s office also plans, with this move, to make changes in the staffing.
Currently:
• 3 full time staff and 2 part-time staff at 12 hours each.
• Both part-time staff are not included in the funds covered by KDADS. One is on loan
from the Governor’s office and will retire in September; this person returns
approximately 40% of the contacts. The other is the part-time supervisor for the Wichita
satellite office and is part of a grant that is ending June 30, 2018.
Proposed:
• Funding for 5 full-time staff
• Add a full-time volunteer coordinator in each satellite office that will also take complex
calls and recruit, train and supervise volunteers in those offices.
Results:
• More coverage for the increasing contacts with the KanCare Ombudsman’s office.
o The two staff in the satellite offices will have responsibilities that will cover the
part-time person taking 40% of contacts.
• Placing a Volunteer coordinator in each satellite office will improve the volunteer
recruitment and coverage.
o We have maintained an average of 4 volunteers in both locations. The goal is to
have 10 volunteers in each office to cover hours from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm.
o A full-time volunteer coordinator at each satellite office will allow more focus for
recruitment and training.
• Increased staff and volunteer coverage will allow the offices to provide more assistance
for grievances, appeals and state fair hearings, especially for those with long-term
supports and services.
Increase in contacts
The contacts for the KanCare Ombudsman’s office have increased dramatically in just the last
year. (contacts up 99% from 4th quarter last year and January up almost 50% to 4th quarter 2017.)
The staff are having difficulty keeping up with the increasing contacts and are using comp time to
assist with making timely contacts with beneficiaries. One of the comments from the review by
CMS in October 2016 was concern that the Ombudsman’s office has adequate staff to handle the
contacts. This proposed staffing change will address the coverage concerns.

Fiscal Information
The fiscal note includes:
• There will be no fiscal impact to the Department of Administration
• KDADS will cover the funds for the current costs of the Ombudsman office; the funds will
follow the Ombudsman’s office to the Department of Administration.
The fiscal note does not address:
• Additional costs for two new staff
• Costs for operations (i.e. rent, utilities, office supplies and technology, phones, subcontracts
with satellite offices, printing, etc.) These costs were absorbed by KDADS; the
Ombudsman did not have a budget.
• Costs for moving the office (purchase of furniture, creating the office space, purchasing
supplies and small office equipment that was generally available at KDADS, etc.)
The Ombudsman budget for the next two years is shown in the chart below.
• The funds from KDADS would be $83,500 (state funds) for staff.
• The total state funds needed for FY2019 is $216,748.
• The total state funds needed for FY2020 is $202,073. The lower cost in 2020 is from no
moving/startup costs in the second year.
• There has been some discussion regarding an annual contract fee to large organizations,
that benefit from the Ombudsman’s office, to cover the balance of the required funds (i.e.
the three Managed Care Organization and Maximus.) At this point in time the it would be
around $34,000 for four organization annually. If an additional MCO is added, the cost
would be approximately $27,000 for five organizations annually.

The decision being made regarding this bill is two-fold:
1. Whether it makes sense for the beneficiaries and their families to have a more independent
KanCare Ombudsman.
2. Providing timely assistance for those contacting the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman’s
office now and in the future.
Thank you again for allowing me to provide you with this testimony. I am happy to answer any
questions.

Topeka, Kansas 66612
Dear Representative Hawkins:
SUBJECT:

Fiscal Note for HB 2663 by House Committee on Health and Human
Services

In accordance with KSA 75-3715a, the following fiscal note concerning HB 2663 is
respectfully submitted to your committee.
HB 2663 would enact the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman Act. The bill would create the
Office of the State KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman in Topeka, Kansas attached to the Department
of Administration. The Department would provide technical assistance and advice to assist the
Office to function as an independent state agency. The Department would have no authority over
the State KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman or employees or volunteers of the Office with respect to
the performance of any power, duty or function of the Office or the exercise of any other authority
of the Office. The State KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman would be appointed by the Governor,
subject to confirmation by the Senate.
The State KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman would administer the office and hire all staff
and employees of the Office. The Office of the State KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman, in existence
before the effective date of the Act, would be abolished. The bill would transfer all previous
powers, duties, functions, records, property and employees, currently housed in the Kansas
Department for Aging and Disability Services, to the Office created by this Act. The employees
would retain all retirement benefits and leave rights and the service of each employee transferred
would be deemed continuous.
The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services states that enactment of HB
2663 would not have a fiscal effect on the agency. Any funding that is currently used for
expenditures would be transferred to the Office.

The Honorable Daniel Hawkins, Chairperson

Page 2—HB 2663

The Department of Administration anticipates that enactment of HB 2663 would result in
$1,000 of moving costs. Any assistance provided by the Department of Administration would be
absorbed within existing resources. Any fiscal effect associated with HB 2663 is not reflected in
The FY 2019 Governor’s Budget Report.

Sincerely,

Larry L. Campbell
Chief Budget Officer
