Testimony in Support of HB 2663 Enacting the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman Act
By Martha K. Gabehart, Executive Director
Kansas Commission on Disability Concerns (KCDC)
March 6, 2018
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee members, for the opportunity to testify in support of HB
2663 which creates the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman Act. I am Martha Gabehart, Executive Director
of the Kansas Commission on Disability Concerns (KCDC). KCDC is a catalyst for change in government
for people with disabilities. We work with the governor, legislature and state agencies on issues that
adversely affect Kansans with disabilities.
I was loaned to the KanCare Ombudsman’s office two years ago for three half-days a week to help
answer calls and emails from KanCare members, applicants, providers and others about issues with
KanCare. I have experienced the increase in contacts and requests for assistance with filing for state
fair hearings and communicating with the KanCare Clearinghouse. There is no service that is helping
everyone who wants to file for a state fair hearing. The KanCare Ombudsman staff is not able to
respond to requests for one-on-one help filing for and/or preparing for these hearings. Information is
supplied on how to file for a state fair hearing and how to contact the Office of Administrative
Hearings.
The Ombudsman’s office needs more staff to keep up with this growing demand for assistance and the
growing need for assistance with state fair hearings. KCDC supports HB 2663 and the efforts to help
Medicaid recipients and applicants receive and maintain those services.
Thank you again for this opportunity. If there are questions, please feel free to contact me.
