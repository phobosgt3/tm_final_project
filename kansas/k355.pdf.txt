Good afternoon Chairman Hawkins and members of the committee. I am Jon Hamdorf, Medicaid
Director and Director of the Division of Health Care Finance and I am providing supporting written
testimony on behalf of KDHE for HB 2663, Enacting the KanCare/Medicaid Ombudsman Act.

Our primary concern is to provide the individuals we serve in the KanCare program the highest
level of service and support. While we strive for excellence, there are times when individuals on
our program need assistance navigating the system, getting additional information about services
and providers, and filing appeals and grievances. The role of the KanCare Ombudsman is to serve
as a point of contact to provide and/or facilitate the assistance that the individual requires.

We feel that HB 2663 will establish the KanCare Ombudsman as a truly independent resource for
the individuals on our program. Currently, the KanCare Ombudsmanâ€™s budget and physical
location resides within the Kansas Department of Aging and Disability Services. By moving the
Office of the KanCare Ombudsman to the Department of Administration and by removing any ties
to agencies which provide services to the individuals on the KanCare program, the KanCare
Ombudsman will have more independence to operate and serve the needs of the individuals on
KanCare.
We respect and support the Office of the KanCare Ombudsman and appreciate your consideration
of our testimony.

Thank You,
Jon Hamdorf
Medicaid Director and Director of Health Care Finance
Kansas Department of Health and Environment
