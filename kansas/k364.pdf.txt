Testimony in Support of Senate Bill 51
Before the House Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
Katie Whisman, Executive Officer
Kansas Bureau of Investigation
March 8, 2017
Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of Senate Bill 51 which amends the definition
of controlled substance analog and expands the authority of the Kansas Board of Pharmacy to
schedule dangerous drugs on an emergency basis. I would like to explain why these changes are
critical to the public safety of Kansas citizens.
Each year, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KB) works very closely with the Kansas Board
of Pharmacy to put forth a yearly legislative update to the Kansas uniform controlled substances
act. This effort is intended to ensure we stay ahead of emerging drug threats in Kansas. Last
year’s drug schedule update was passed as Senate Substitute for House Bill 2018, signed by
Governor Brownback on May 17, 2016, and became effective upon publication in the Kanas
Register.
On May 24, 2016, I was contacted by a Detective Sergeant with the Olathe Police Department.
Their agency had responded to and was growing increasingly concerned about a number of drugrelated overdose deaths occurring in their community. Based on information discovered at the
death scenes, they suspected the deaths were attributed to U-47700.
U-47700 is a synthetic opioid analgesic drug that is not intended for human consumption, is
nearly eight times more potent than morphine, and is suspected of recently contributing to
dozens of drug-related overdose deaths across the country. Its effects, which include sedation
and respiratory depression, are instantaneous and deadly. It is not currently controlled in Kansas
and is readily available for purchase over the internet.
While we were working with the Olathe Police Department, Johnson County District Attorney’s
Office, and the Kansas Board of Pharmacy to evaluate the possibility of controlling U-47700 by
way of emergency scheduling, the KBI took steps to make the Kansas law enforcement
community aware of this epidemic and issued a press release on June 2, 2016 to warn citizens
about the threat posed by U-47700. We became aware of U-47700 suspected drug-related
overdose deaths occurring in other jurisdictions in Kansas.

After several conversations between the KBI, local law enforcement, the county prosecutor, and
the Board of Pharmacy, we concluded that a combination of Kansas statutes prevented us from
controlling U-47700 by way of emergency scheduling. As such, we’ve waited months for the
opportunity to include U-47700 in the 2017 yearly update to the Kansas uniform controlled
substances act. That is addressed in a separate bill, Senate Bill 52.
Senate Bill 51 is the result of a multidisciplinary group of individuals, each impacted by the U47700 situation, which came together and critically evaluated what statutory changes could be
made to allow for the necessary emergency scheduling of dangerous substances while still
ensuring that the Board of Pharmacy retains oversight of that process.
We are confident that the changes proposed in Senate Bill 51 will enhance our ability to control
dangerous drugs that pose imminent risks to the health and welfare of Kansas citizens. Its timely
passage is critical to public safety.
The Kansas Bureau of Investigation strongly supports Senate Bill 51 and respectfully asks the
Committee to recommend it favorably for passage.
I would be happy to stand for questions.
