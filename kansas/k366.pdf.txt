SB52
Adding and amending substances included in schedules I, II and V of the
uniform controlled substances act.
Nick Reinecker Opponent Testimony
March 8, 2017
House Health and Human Services
Rep. Dan Hawkins Chair

Why opponent?
• As a former police officer and parent of two children, I am for a controlled
substances act for those synthetics that present an obvious threat to Public
Health and Safety such as “crack” cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin etc.
• I am not for a legislative mechanism that generates revenue or justifies the existence of
agencies, private prisons, low-hanging fruit asset seizure/forfeiture and court ordered
treatment imposed on citizens involved in the possession, consumption and production
of botanicals specific to cannabis in its naturally occurring form. This abuse has resulted
in the need of a rebirth pertaining to the inherent inalienable rights of Kansas citizens to
use cannabis agriculture for fuel, fiber, nutrition and other supplemental uses without
fear of government intrusion, overregulation and the use of “alternative facts”.
• My main objection to cannabis being on the schedule of controlled substances wholly and
especially specific to schedule one is the lack of consistency when dealing with other
substances that are clearly more dangerous and deadly, and yet, can be marketed, prescribed
and/or used at freewill by the general public.
• I would support this bill if it was amended to de-schedule cannabis in its natural form.
• Adding SB178 or other

I believe in individual liberty, limited government, state's rights, fair trade and a Doctor-patient relationship
that is unfettered. The past four year I have listened and watched, both in person and online, to the plethora of
debate in committee hearings, on the floor of the House and Senate chambers, in the halls of the Kansas
Statehouse, on social media and during coffee hour at the local cafe my family runs in central Kansas. A lot of time
has been spent in the current and past legislative session talking about alcohol, tobacco, gaming, tax increases and
other questionable policy trajectories that were and could be implemented for the purposes of a balanced budget,
proper regulation for the care and protection of the vulnerable and suffering, economic growth and of course the
still small voice of another pending election cycle. I believe all of us in here care about proper government roles
and responsibilities, constitutional public safety and health strategies, and of course, the rule of law. However when
those in opposition of cannabis reform become dependent on laws that conflict with basic human needs and the
principals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that are described in the Declaration of Independence and the
United States Constitution, it becomes necessary to return to the basics of government. The protection of
inalienable rights that are not the government's to give or take away. I contend that knocking doors down, seizing
property and the interrogation, detainment, arrest, confinement and monitoring of our citizenry should be confined
to those activities that are violent in nature or in this case involve synthetic substances such as methamphetamine,
crack cocaine and heroin and not naturally occurring substances, such as cannabis, that have proven industrial and
patented therapeutic value. The state of Kansas is currently in an agricultural and fiscal crisis, we are losing
population to other states and people are going out of state to buy their consumables. We have food deserts where
convenience stores sell, alcohol, tobacco, unhealthy snacks, lottery and gas all taxed and regulated and condoned by
the Kansas Legislature. It is time to take cannabis out of the hands of street thugs who prey on our children and
into a well regulated system of taxation and regulation.

I have been a Certified Nurse Aide in both hospital and allied health settings, I have been a Firefighter. I have
been an EMT. I have been a Police Officer. I have taken care of a dying father. I ask for you to just simply realize
that all Kansans as well as all Americans are becoming victims of certain potentially harmful state and federal
laws and policies concerning what we as citizens can put into or expose our own individual bodies to. We are
being told what and how to produce. We are being told what we can eat, what diseases we ‘suffer’ from and
then we are told what marketed synthetic drugs to take to combat, through an endless monthly payment plan,
the sicknesses, thereof. Maybe its your brother, maybe its your mother, maybe its your cousin, maybe its your
best friend, maybe its just you, needlessly suffering physically, psychologically, emotionally, and/or financially; all
for the sake of a profitable stock quote. Not to mention the enormous drain on precious law enforcement
resources that cannabis prohibition consumes.
We have a proud history of patriotism, liberty, and continued concepts of living off the land, which we call
agriculture and steadfast prayer that I am proud to say represents what Kansas means to me. These things are
why I am taking a stand. Not to mention the fact that most of us, including myself, have sons and daughters that
are going to reap whatever good and bad consequences we choose to face them with. As a former EMT, I am
tired of seeing the influx of baby-boomers now afflicted with physical medical ailments possibly stemming from
synthetic food preservatives, dyes, medications, and overuse of antibiotics; where pharmaceutical morality is
being questioned and stocks of companies are dancing to the memos of the FDA fax machine. As a Kansan, I am
tired of seeing agricultural producers being sold out or bullied into conforming to flagrant privatized-social
violations of the producer’s rights. Sure they are protected by whistle-blowers when it affects the bottom line.
But…what is the bottom line, the dollar or life itself?

• States with medical marijuana laws
had a 24.8 percent lower average
annual opioid overdose death rate
compared to states without such
laws. In 2010, that translated to
about 1,729 fewer deaths than
expected. The years after
implementation of medical marijuana
laws also were associated with lower
overdose death rates that generally
got stronger over time: year 1 (-19.9
percent), year 2 (-25.2 percent), year
3 (-23.6 percent), year 4 (-20.2
percent), year 5 (-33.7 percent)…

Commerce, Labor and Economic Development
from Kansas Cannabis Industry: HB2182
• Commerce
• New revenue stream for Kansas
producers and the State

• Labor
• Farm, Processing, Manufacturing,
Retail
• Healthcare, Teachers etc.

• Economic Development
• Farming options ,Processing Plant,
Manufacturing Plants, Retail needs
• Healthcare, Schools, Grocery Stories
etc.

• I live in a town of 1200 people and my wife
and I run the local café. We use real butter,
make much of the food from scratch and
don’t expect to ever have a Ferrari. We serve
farmers and workers, families and friends.
The truth is, we need an influx of commerce,
labor and economic development and one
option is to build a cannabis plant in this little
town that recently annexed some land perfect
for this operation that could bring new
families and workers to town, new housing
and more options for our local struggling
farmers. De-scheduling cannabis will also
allow good palliative care, death with dignity
and many more benefits that far outweigh
the negatives. Please decriminalize, tax and
regulate this agricultural commodity.

Vigilance in Liberty
• Kansas allows citizens to
homebrew beer and wine
• Kansas allows general gardening
for nutrition
• Kansas promotes state’s rights in
guns, elections etc.
• Kansas entered into the union as
a free state showing that slavery
was a cause to fight

We the People of the United
States, in Order to form a more
perfect Union, establish Justice,
insure domestic Tranquility,
provide for the common defense,
promote the general Welfare, and
secure the Blessings of Liberty to
ourselves and our Posterity, do
ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States
of America

Excerpt from Ecclesiastes 3
To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven: …A time to tear, And a time to sew; A time to keep
silence, And a time to speak; A time to love, And a time to hate; A time of war, And a time of peace.
