Testimony for Public Hearing
House Health and Human Services Committee
March 14, 2017
James Covel
Public Policy and Communications Specialist
Alzheimer's Association of Central and Western Kansas
Chairman Hawkins and Members of the House Health and Human Services Committee,
My name is James Covel and I am the Public Policy lead for the Alzheimer's Association. In
that role, I have had the honor of working with both caregivers and persons with dementia, as
we all work to figure out how to support quality of life and how to minimize the more
traumatic symptoms of the disease. The Alzheimer's Association supports Senate Bill 68.
Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia disease do not discriminate, they are a human disease.
They have a 100% mortality rate, and there are no cures, treatments, or effective prevention
measures. They devastate families, and place tremendous burden on our medical system.
Supporting Kansas caregivers is key to easing the coming public health crisis of Alzheimer's
disease, as the number of afflicted individuals is expected to increase by over 11,000 by 2025.
Care planning is one of the few things that can help families obtain peace of mind, and keep
dementia patients in their home longer.
The provisions in this bill, which would allow caregivers to receive the training they need to
effectively care for their loved ones, are tantamount to increasing the quality of life of
caregivers. On top of this, research shows that provisions such as this one allow dementia
patients to live in their homes for a longer period before moving to assisted living facilities. This
not only places a lower burden on the Medicaid and Medicare systems to finance those services
but it will help increase the quality of life of over 150,00 family dementia caregivers and their
loved ones.
We ask you to join us and the over 150,000 family dementia caregivers in Kansas and vote in
favor of this bill.

Thank you,

James Covel
