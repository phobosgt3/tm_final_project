Testimony on Senate Bill 154
House Committee on Health and Human Services
Ashley Goss, Interim Deputy Secretary for Medicaid and Public Health
Kansas Department of Health and Environment
March 13, 2017

Chairman Hawkins and members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today to
speak in support of SB 154.
SB 154 transfers authority for health occupations credentialing from KDHE to KDADS and amends related
statutes. Executive Reorganization Order 41 moved Health Occupations Credentialing to the newly created
“KDADS” effective July 1, 2012. The bill updates statutes to reflect changes that have occurred within the state
departments and clarify definitions used in the Act. SB 154 also allows for a tiered system of licensure for Home
Health Agencies based on the level of home health services provided to patients/clients and updates the Home
Health licensing statutes, K.S.A. 65-5101 through 65-5117, which have not been revised since 2006. KDHE is
the lead agency for administration and licensure of Home Health Agencies and promulgates associated
regulations/foundational standards for compliance.
Pursuant to recommendations from this committee during the 2016 Legislative Session the Kansas Department
of Health and Environment Health Facilities Program contacted and met multiple times with representatives of
both proponents and opponents to last year’s proposed changes to Home Health Statutes. From those meetings
we were able to draft acceptable regulations that meet the needs of patients without being excessively burdensome
on the industry. The statutory changes in SB154 allow the implementation of those agreed upon regulations.
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to explain the benefits of this bill. I will now stand for
questions.
