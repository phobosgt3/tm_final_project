Testimony concerning SB 282
House Committee on Health and Human Services
March 8, 2018
Chairman Hawkins and Members of the Committee:
The Kansas State Board of Pharmacy is pleased to testify as a proponent of SB 282. These amendments
include vital updates to the Kansas Uniform Controlled Substances Act to protect Kansas citizens. The
Board strongly agrees that timely passage is paramount to public safety and respectfully requests that the
contents of SB 282 not be unnecessarily entangled with other matters.
The Kansas State Board of Pharmacy (Board) is created by statute and is comprised of seven members,
each of whom is appointed by the Governor. Of the seven, six are licensed pharmacists and one is a
member of the general public. Pursuant to K.S.A. 65-4102(b), the Board is required to submit to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate a report on substances proposed
by the Board for scheduling, rescheduling or deletion by the legislature with respect to any one of the
schedules as set forth in the Kansas Uniform Controlled Substances Act, K.S.A. 65-4101 et seq. The
Board submitted the aforementioned letter the week of January 22, 2018. In its determination, the Board
shall consider the following:
(1) The actual or relative potential for abuse;
(2) The scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known;
(3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance;
(4) The history and current pattern of abuse;
(5) The scope, duration and significance of abuse;
(6) The risk to the public health;
(7) The potential of the substance to produce psychological or physiological dependence
liability; and
(8) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under the
Controlled Substances Act.
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) also issues their rulings based on information provided by
the DEA’s Deputy Administrator and the Department of Health and Human Services using the same
factors and criteria that the state uses.
The Board staff has an ongoing relationship with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) and meets
regularly with them to discuss drugs of concern and make necessary recommendations for updates to the
Act. In October, we began the dialogue and have conducted a comparison of the controlled substances
listed in Schedules I-V of the Federal Controlled Substances in addition to data from other states and the
KBI forensic science lab in order to protect the public health and safety of Kansans. This bill is the result

of that work, and the Board fully supports the changes proposed in SB 282 and agrees with the KBI’s
testimony.
Congress created five schedules or classifications with varying qualifications for a substance to be
included in each. The Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and the Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) make recommendations after considering various factors that indicate the drug should have
more restrictions.
• Schedule I are those drugs that have a high potential for abuse and have no accepted medical use
in treatment in the United States.
• Schedule II substances have a high potential for abuse but have an accepted medical use in the
United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. Abuse of the drug
may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
• Schedule III substances have less potential for abuse than drugs in Schedule I or II and they have
an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse may lead to moderate or low
physical dependence or high psychological dependence.
• Schedule IV substances have a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs in Schedule III. The
substances have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse may
lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to drugs or substances
in Schedule III.
• Schedule V substances have a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs in Schedule IV. The
drug or substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse
of the drug may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the
drugs or substances in Schedule IV.
The Board recommends the following substances be added to Schedule II:
ANPP, an immediate precursor to fentanyl; and
Dronabinol in an oral solution in a drug product approved for marketing by the FDA, which was
federally scheduled on March 23, 2017. The rule and explanation can be found at:

The Board recommends that the following drugs be added to Schedule I because they present an
imminent and significant risk to the health and safety of the public:
acryl fentanyl, cyclopentyl fentanyl, cyclopropyl fentanyl, isobutyryl fentanyl, methoxyacetyl
fentanyl, ocfentanil, ortho-fluorofentanyl, para-chloroisobutyryl fentanyl, para-fluorobutyryl
fentanyl, para-methoxybutyryl fentanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl fentanyl, valeryl fentanyl, MT-45,
mitragynine, and 7-hydroxymitragynine.
Many of the proposed changes have already been temporarily or permanently added to the federal
schedules. The Board also recommends updating the cannabinoid classes of drugs to include a new
indole-3-carboxamide synthetic cannabinoid class, cyanoalkyl substitution in all classes, and cyanoalkyl
and an additional benzyl substitution in the indazole-3-carbaxamide class.
After the Committee’s informational hearing on March 5, 2018, the Board has also included some
information specific to mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (Kratom) and the need for inclusion in
Schedule I. According to the 2017 DEA Resource Guide, consumption of Kratom leaves produces
stimulant effects in low doses and sedative effects similar to morphine in high doses, can lead to
psychotic symptoms, and psychological as well as physiological dependence. The National Institutes of
Health indicates that Kratom leaves have psychoactive alkaloids that produce opioid-like activity in the
brain and has no medicinal value. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime included Kratom in its
Early Warning on New Pscyhoactive Substances (plant-based) in 2013 which are defined as “substances
of abuse, either in a pure form or a preparation, that are not controlled by the 1961 Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs or the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, but which may pose a public health
threat” (https://www.unodc.org/LSS/Page/NPS). Chronic use of Kratom may be associated with acute
liver injury or hepatotoxicity, while overdoses can cause seizures, coma and death
(https://livertox.nih.gov/Kratom.htm). While the internet says the LD50 of Kratom is 5g/kg, it is difficult
to locate any peer-reviewed medical study that supports this finding.
In September 2016, the Board received correspondence from New Mexico regarding six poisonings
from Kratom which resulted in four hospitalizations for moderate to major symptoms. Officials
identified the substance as a threat and further indicated a high likelihood of Kratom being combined
with other chemicals and substances with an even higher likelihood of dependence and abuse.
Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to provide a comprehensive report on poisonings related to this
substance because it is not widely tested. However, the public health risk is significant because of the
lack of regulation of the substance, the misleading information and consumer marketing associated with
consuming a substance not intended for medical use, and the frequency with which this substance is
Page 4 of 5

combined or mixed with other illicit and controlled substances. It is concerning and dangerous when a
substance can only be legally imported by labeling it “not for human consumption” and yet it is held-out
by advocates as safe for human consumption.
On February 6, 2018, the FDA issued another statement on the agency’s recent scientific research and
evidence on the presence of opioid compounds in Kratom and underscoring the potential for abuse. FDA
scientists found Kratom shares the most structural similarities with controlled substance opioid
analgesics like morphine, and is known to activate opioid receptors in the brain. In fact, the FDA now
considers the compounds found in Kratom to be opioids. This is the same class of drugs that have
caused a national health crisis which was recognized by Governor Colyer, M.D., last week in his
Executive Order. But unlike other controlled opioids, Kratom has not been reviewed or tested for safety
or effectiveness. To date, there is no evidence of any medical use – an essential qualification for placing
a substance in Schedule I of the Kansas Controlled Substances Act.

It is also important to note that the Board of Pharmacy has statutory authority to schedule, on an
emergency basis, certain new drugs or analogs of existing controlled substances which present an
imminent hazard to the public safety until such time as the legislature reconvenes and considers the need
to permanently schedule such substances. If the legislature chooses to remove mitragynine and 7hydroxymitragynine from SB 282, the Board would not have authority to emergency schedule this
substance should the need arise. The Board has always worked with the KBI to provide a robust and
proactive approach to scheduling controlled substances in Kansas, and failure to pass SB 282 in its
current form may pose a danger to Kansas citizens that cannot be remedied until the next legislative
session.
Respectfully submitted.
