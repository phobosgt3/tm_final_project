Testimony to the House Health and Human Services Committee
In Support of SB282
March 8, 2018
Chairman Hawkins and Committee Members:
Our associations strongly support SB282 making modifications in the drug schedules. These
modifications are the culmination of a great deal of work by the Board of Pharmacy, our crime
labs, law enforcement agencies, and many other interested organizations.
For law enforcement, these schedule revisions are critical in keeping up with illicit drug
manufacturing and trafficking trends aimed at putting dangerous compounds on the street. This
year, among other things, we are trying to keep ahead of the purge of opioid related compounds
we are seeing in the illicit drug trade. The KBI testimony has explained in detail what these are
and why each is needed. We support that information which the KBI has compiled from the crime
lab experts.
In addition to the opioid problem, we continue to fight the designer drugs we find in our state.
These drugs are modifications designed to circumvent the current detailed chemical descriptions
found in the schedules. Keeping up with these new innovations by those putting harmful drugs in
the hands of our children and families is critical to public safety.
Kansas is fortunate to have the close working relationship between the medical, pharmacy,
treatment providers, law enforcement, and crime lab professions. It is through these efforts we will
minimize the impact of dangerous drug trends in our state. But it can only happen with your
support, including passing this bill favorably.
