Statement of LuGina Mendez-Harper, Pharm.D., R.Ph.
Government Affairs Principal
Prime Therapeutics
Senate Bill 351
House Insurance Committee
March 6, 2018

Chairman Vickrey and Committee Members:
Thank you for the opportunity to submit written comments regarding Senate Bill 351.
My name is Dr. LuGina Mendez-Harper. I am a pharmacist with Prime Therapeutics and a proud
graduate of the University of Kansas College of Pharmacy.
Prime Therapeutics is a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) owned by 17 not-for-profit Blue Cross Blue
Shield plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas (BCBS-KS).
The amendments to Senate Bill 351 represent agreed upon language addressing consumers paying the
lowest price for their medicines, the pharmacist’s ability to discuss a patient’s cost share and to sell a
more affordable alternative.
Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Thank you.
