We appreciate the opportunity to provide our perspective as both a significant empIoyer of phamacists
and phamacy technicians, aS Well as a Phamacy Care Services provider to hundreds of thousands of
Kansans on the impact of the Kansas Pharmaの′ Patients F宏ir Praclices Act.

Broadly speaking, this bi11 is detrimental to the Kansas health care system because it undermines the
ability to use tooIs that help drive demonstrative improvements in patient health outcomes and cost

SaVings that we have been able to successfully achieve for our customers. OptumRx was able to keep

phamacy cost trend down to 2.7% for its customers in 2017l. our clinical programs have led to: a 7%
reduction in in‑Patient and emergency room admissions2; 30% improved adherence through

threatened by this bi11・

We have evaluated the proposed legislation and believe strongly that it will:
・ Undemine PBMs

ability to help controI spiraling preschption drug prices for our

Public and private sector customers and their members;
. Increase drug costs to the State, emPIoyers, and consumers;
・ Interfere in the contractual relationship between a PBM and a phamacy;

. Limit the quality and perfomance programs we have with phamacies, to the
detriment of patient care and consumer satisfaction;
・ Undemine proven tooIs used by PBMs to Iower drugs costs; and
・ Provide no meaningful benefits to patients.

We appreciate the opportunity to share our concems・ For the reasons stated above, We reSPeCtfully

OPPOSe this bill as drafted.

We would welcome the opportunity to work with the Legislature to advance workable policy solutions
to reduce drug costs for Kansans.
