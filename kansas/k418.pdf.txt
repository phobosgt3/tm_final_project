Testimony re: SB 386
House Health and Human Services Committee
By
Andrew Secor
President-Elect, Kansas Counseling Association
March 7, 2018

Mister Chairman and Members of the Committee,
My name is Andrew Secor, President-Elect of the Kansas Counseling Association (KCA). The
KCA represents professional counselors throughout the State of Kansas. As a branch of the
American Counseling Association (ACA), KCA is committed to the licensing of professional
counselors throughout the State of Kansas that meet the academic and clinical training requirements
to become a licensed professional counselor (LPC).
SB 386 proposes a change to the language of the professional counseling licensure criteria to
include individuals from a “related profession” and not only those individuals who have a
counseling degree. KCA supports licensing only of those individuals who meet the academic and
training standards to become a professional counselor. With that said, lacking the term
“counseling” in one’s degree, while meeting all other academic and training requirements for
professional counseling, should not prevent an otherwise trained individual from obtaining
licensure in Kansas.
For these reasons, KCA does not object to the proposed changes in the licensure criteria as stated in
SB 386. The current process of determining an individual’s eligibility for licensure as a
professional counselor should continue to ensure that only individuals who meet professional
counseling academic and training requirements become licensed to practice in Kansas. This
process ensures the protection of the public and the profession by providing licensure only to those
individuals who have the knowledge and experience to provide professional counseling services.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit this written testimony,

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Kim Urenda
