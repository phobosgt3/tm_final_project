What is

?



The National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) is a real-time electronic
logging system used by pharmacies and law enforcement to track
sales of over-the-counter (OTC) cold and allergy medications
containing precursors to the illegal drug, methamphetamine, such as
Pseudophedrine.



There are approximately 528 pharmacies that are actively using NPLEx
in Kansas. Those pharmacies that do not sell ephedrine or
pseudoephedrine items over the counter are exempt from reporting.

K-TRACS
KANSAS PRESCRIPTION MONITORING PROGRAM

11

1/18/2017

What is


The Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) in Kansas.


Monitors Schedule II-IV controlled substance prescriptions, as well as drugs of
concern dispensed within the state as reported by pharmacies and other
dispensers



Program administered by the Board of Pharmacy



K-TRACS is a web-accessible database, available 24 hours, that provides
tools to help address one of the largest threats to patient safety in the
state of Kansas: the misuse, abuse, and diversion of controlled
pharmaceutical substances

The Need for K-TRACS


Education and Information. PMPs provide useful feedback to prescribers on their
own prescribing trends as well as their patients’ controlled substance histories.
PMPs also provide useful information to prescribers when they suspect that a
patient may be non-compliant in their controlled substance use.



Public Health Initiatives. The public health community can use information from
the PMP to monitor trends and address controlled substance prescribing or
utilization problems.



Drug Abuse and Diversion Prevention. Prescribers, dispensers, and consumers will
be deterred from participating in illegal drug diversion schemes if they know a
PMP is in place.



Early Intervention. Identify patients for early assessment and treatment of potential
controlled substance utilization problems.
