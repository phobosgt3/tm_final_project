Remarks in Support of House Bill No. 2674
House Committee on Health and Human Services
February 12, 2018
Dear Chairman Hawkins and Members of the House Committee on Health and Human Services:
My name is Doug Smith and I serve as Executive Director of the Kansas Academy of Physician
Assistants (KAPA). Thank you for allowing the Kansas Academy of Physician Assistants to
provide written testimony in support of House Bill No. 2674.
The Kansas Academy of Physician Assistants is a constituent organization of the American
Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) and was founded in 1975 as the official representative
voice for the Physician Assistants (PA) in Kansas. KAPA’s purpose is to enhance the quality of
medical care of the citizens of Kansas by promoting the profession and providing medical
education resources to physician assistants, other health professionals, policymaking bodies and
to the public.
In 1975, Kansas had 35 PAs practicing and today more than 1,000 PAs maintain an active
license through the State Board of Healing Arts.
PAs are a critical life-line to primary care in Kansas, particularly in rural areas and have proven
their value in the medical community. The profession continues to mature and has become a
significant force in the nation’s health care delivery system.
Telemedicine services are a valuable tool for today's healthcare providers and can significantly
improve the level of care provided to all, especially underserved populations, by providing
access to care which benefits to both the patients and the providers.
The Kansas Academy of Physician Assistants appears today in support of House Bill No. 2674
which addresses the parity in provider payment for healthcare services through
telecommunications.
We ask you to support House Bill No. 2674.
Thank you for your consideration.
