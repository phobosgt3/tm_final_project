To: Chairman Dan Hawkins, and Members of The House Health and Human Services
Committee
My name is Dr. Damon “Chris” Dixon, M.D. I represent Anesthesia Associates of Kansas
City, and we are supporters of HB2046.
As stated by the American Society of Anesthesiologists: Anesthesia Assistants (AAs) are
recognized by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as non-physician
anesthetists with identical standing to nurse anesthetists, and the services of AAs and nurse
anesthetists on a care team are paid for by CMS and by commercial insurers on an equal
basis. AAs are authorized to work in any VA hospital, and they work side by side with nurse
anesthetists in many academic departments and private anesthesia practices.
The care team model is the best model for the care and safety of patients during surgery.
The patient benefits from the more extensive training of the physician. Safety is also
enhanced by redundancy of a second healthcare provider, without doubling the
costs. Patients want and trust physician led care. Hospitals who have a choice, choose
physician led care.
Allowing AAs in Kansas promotes a proven culture of safety. There is no intention to
exclude anyone from the healthcare team. On the contrary, to achieve the goal of
increased safety and access, reduced costs, and better patient experience, we are going to
need “all hands on deck.”
When you consider HB2046, we respectfully request favorable passage.
Sincerely,

Damon C. Dixon, M.D.
