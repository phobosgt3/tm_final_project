Written-Only Testimony in Support of HB 2047
House Health and Human Services Committee
January 31, 2017
Chairman Hawkins and members of the Committee:
My name is Mike Burgess. I am the Director of Policy & Outreach at the Disability
Rights Center of Kansas (DRC). DRC is a public interest legal advocacy
organization that is part of a national network of federally mandated organizations
empowered to advocate for Kansans with disabilities. DRC is the officially
designated protection and advocacy system in Kansas. DRC is a private, 501(c)(3)
nonprofit corporation, organizationally independent of state government and whose
sole interest is the protection of the legal rights of Kansans with disabilities.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB
2047.
The purpose of the office of inspector general is to establish a full-time program of
audit, investigation and performance review to provide increased accountability,
integrity and oversight of the state Medicaid program.
Unfortunately this position has remained unfilled for nearly three years.
We support having an independent and empowered KanCare Inspector General.
Moving the position outside of the State Medicaid agency is a positive step
towards realizing the vision of the IG. The IG will also need to have adequate
resources, authority, and access to information to be able to do the job.
If passed, this bill would be one of several bills and concrete steps the Legislature
can and should take to improve the KanCare Medicaid program.
Thank you for the opportunity to share our support with you. I would be happy to
stand for questions at the appropriate time.
