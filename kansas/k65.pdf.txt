Committee on Health and Human Services
Testimony in support of HB2047
Jan. 31, 2017
Chairman Hawkins and members of the committee:
The KanCare Advocates Network is a group of advocates whose collective interests include issues
impacting children and adults who are served by the Kansas Medicaid program, KanCare. We are
testifying today to share our support for HB2047.
The KanCare Advocates Network and other advocacy organizations have long worked for greater
independence as well as filling the position of KanCare Inspector General. We believe that this bill is
a vast improvement on the current situation without this position. The position of Inspector General
has been unfilled since 2014 and is housed within the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment, the agency it is charged with overseeing. For these reasons we strongly support
moving this position out of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
We hope that this position is filled as soon as possible and that the new Inspector General is allowed
as much autonomy as possible to carry out the duties of the office. We look forward to working with
this committee in the future to improve KanCare and make it work better for all involved.
Thank you once again for allowing us the opportunity to support HB2047.
Sincerely,

Sean Gatewood
KanCare Advocates Network
