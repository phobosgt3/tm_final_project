Written Testimony re: HB 2055
House Health and Human Services Committee
Presented by Julie J. Hein
on behalf of
Kansas Association of Chain Drug Stores
February 19, 2017
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:
My name is Julie Hein, and I am a Government Affairs Consultant for the Kansas Association of
Chain Drug Stores (KACDS) which represents NACDS member’s including 15 companies operating
over 329 stores in Kansas, employing over 29,600 full and part-time employees and paying over
$459 million in state taxes.
KACDS generally supports HB 2055. We have caught some last minute issues for which we were
unable to provide amendatory language prior to submission of this testimony. Therefore, we
reserve the right to make additional comments and possible amendments at a later time.
We appreciate the Kansas Board of Pharmacy updating the statute to conform to the Federal Drug
Supply Chain Security ACT (DSCSA), updating the Pharmacy Technician and other Pharmacy
Statutes. This bill deals with the following key issues:
•

NACDS/KACDS supports the additional language specifying that pharmacists “may provide
up to a three-month supply of a prescription drug that is not a controlled substance or
psychotherapeutic drug when a practitioner has written a drug order to be filled with a
smaller supply but included sufficient numbers of refills for a three-month supply”.

•

Requires compliance with DSCSA (the federal supply chain law) and makes related updates
to the law impacting wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers.

•

Creates new registration requirements for outsourcing facilities, and requires any facility
that is registered with FDA as an outsourcing facility to register with the KS Board of
Pharmacy.

•

Updates language under KSA 65-1663 related to pharmacy technicians including requiring
techs to complete 20 hours of CE and specifying that every pharmacy technician registered
after July 1, 2016 shall be required to pass a certified pharmacy technician examination
approved by the board.

Thank you for considering our views on HB 2055.
