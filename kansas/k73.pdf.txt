Our First Priority: Caring for
Individuals with Disabilities
•

Caring for individuals with disabilities is the highest
priority

•

Since the inception of KanCare, 5511 individuals from the
waiting lists have been offered service

•

Currently waiting for services are:
•
•

4

3,550 individuals with intellectual and developmental
disabilities
822 individuals with physical disabilities

Our First Priority, continued:
Waiting List Elimination
•

Eliminating the waiting lists cost $1.40 billion from 2018 to
2025, including $629 million in state funds

•

Kansas’ share is $70 million in 2018, increasing to $89
million by 2025

•

This population does not qualify for enhanced match, will
be matched at approximately 55/45

Our Second Priority: Long Term
Fiscal Sustainability
• The Kansas Health Institute (KHI), estimates state costs
would be $729.7 million over seven years. $1.1 billion in
state costs over ten years. Source: Kansas Health Institute - ACA
Medicaid Expansion: Enrollment and Cost Estimates for Kansas Policymakers

• Over $211 million increase from KHI’s projections in the
2012 report.

• Aon Hewitt study estimates that Medicaid expansion in
Kansas would cost the state more than $1.2 billion dollars
in State General Fund (SGF) dollars from CY2016CY2025. Source: Aon Hewitt Analysis updated in 2015

Our Third Priority: Reflecting
Kansas Values
•

Provide able-bodied adults in Kansas a pathway to
independence including:
• Job training and work requirements
• Portable health savings accounts or similar
instruments

•

Work program incentives help to break the cycle of
intergenerational poverty

Uncertainty of the ACA
Multiple Repeal and Replace Proposals, including:
• H.R. 3762 (FY16 Budget Reconciliation)
• Empowering Patients First Act (Tom Price)
• A Better Way (Paul Ryan)
• Patient CARE Act (Burr, Upton, Hatch)
• Heritage Foundation

Uncertainty of Federal Funding
Projection/ACA Promise:
• Federal government will pay at least 90 percent of the
costs of Medicaid expansion
Reality:
• The enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage
(FMAP) passed under the ACA is likely one of the first
things that will be rolled back.
• If the FMAP was rolled back to regular FMAP, it could
cost Kansas $319.1 million (more) in 2018 and $391.6
(more) in 2025. That translates to about $2.75 billion in
additional state funds by 2025
10

Costs of Medicaid Expansion
Projection/ACA Promise:
• Claim is that Medicaid expansion will only cost Kansas $57.5
million in 2017 rising to $114.5 million in 2020 and be budget
neutral

Reality:
• There is no cost benefit to the state
• KHI estimates that expansion would cost $729.7 million in SGF
over seven years, $1.1 billion over 10 years
• An independent actuarial study estimates that Medicaid expansion
would cost Kansas over $1.2 billion in SGF from CY 2016 – CY
2025
• Eliminating the waiting list for individuals with disabilities would
increase Kansas’ cost to $1.4 billion in SGF from 2018 through
2025 to expand Medicaid
11

Medicaid Expansion Enrollment
Projection/ACA Promise:
• Original Medicaid expansion enrollment projections ended up
being approximately half the actual expansion numbers

Reality:
• Under ACA expansion, enrollment has been more than double the
original projections
• 24 of the current Medicaid expansion states made predictions on
enrollment numbers. Every state enrolled more adults than
projected, by an average of 110 percent.
• More than doubling enrollment requires significant fiscal
adjustments to other aspects of a State’s Medicaid programs, or to
other components of state budgets.

12

Impact on Rural Hospitals
Projection/ACA Promise:
• Medicaid expansion will save struggling rural Kansas
hospitals
Reality:
• The vast majority of increased funding in Medicaid
expansion goes to big-city hospitals.
• Many rural hospitals are struggling financially because
of onerous federal regulations.
• As federal Medicare reimbursements decrease, rural
health care providers experience growing financial
gaps
13

Economic Impact/Job Creation
Projection/ACA Promise:
• Medicaid expansion will create thousands of healthcare jobs in
Kansas

Reality:
• Kansas has a problem with shortage of healthcare workers, not
availability of healthcare jobs
• 92 counties are designated as shortage areas for primary care
• 100 counties are designated as shortage areas for mental health
• Kansas already needs an additional 3,827 nurses
• Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) projects a
deficit of 5900 nurses in Kansas by 2020
• Economic multiplier is near zero

Prioritization of State Resources

15

Conclusion
• Estimated $1 billion to expand Medicaid
• Future of the level of federal financial participation is
unknown
• Medicaid expansion states exceeded enrollment
projections by 110 percent
• Kansas is in a much better position than the states that
have expanded Medicaid to weather the repeal of the ACA
and to provide more flexibility and options to Kansans
going forward
