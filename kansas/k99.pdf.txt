House Committee on Health and Human Services
February 1, 2017
Pat George, President / CEO, Valley Hope Association
Good afternoon Chairman Hawkins, and Members of the Committee. This testimony
is submitted in support of House Bill 2106.
As a non-profit organization with locations in seven states with 16 facilities, Valley
Hope supports this bill. Over the last 35 years, Valley Hope has solicited The Joint
Commission accreditation for all of our facilities in our continuum. In the healthcare
arena, this accreditation is one of the esteemed accreditations and organizations that
are awarded it are held in high standard throughout the industry.
When an organization seeks The Joint Commission accreditation, they must meet
rigorous standards which are renewed every three years. In general these standards
are more stringent than state regulations, but also mirror a lot of the same
requirements. Therefore, if an organization would be given “deemed” status in the
state if they have achieved The Joint Commission accreditation, this would allow for
less time spent from management (both locally and corporate) on these inspections
instead of treating individuals in our facilities. In addition to savings of time, this
would also allow for financial savings. As Valley Hope is a charitable organization, any
financial savings allows us to assist more individuals with the chronic disease of
Substance Use Disorder.
Our organization has been given “deemed” status in Arizona, Missouri, Nebraska and
Texas. We have experienced this process to be an efficient and effective way to
continue our national accreditation and state licensing.
Valley Hope applauds the Kansas Legislature in their consideration of allowing
institutions that have already achieved a national accreditation to focus on their
business without having to go through an additional licensing process by the state.
Thank you for the opportunity to share my testimony today.
